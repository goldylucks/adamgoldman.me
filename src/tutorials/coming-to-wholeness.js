Now take a moment to experience Awareness ...

By "Awareness" I mean the actual capacity to notice, A.K.A. "be aware" of stuff in and around you, with your senses.

You are aware of these lines with no effort by your part.

You can feel the keyboard or the mouse touching your hand, again with no effort.

You might be aware of some sounds around you right now as we speak, and you might be aware of your own internal voice reading these lines in your mind.

You are aware of the sensation you’ve just been noticing, so awareness is present there, and awareness is also throughout your body and all around.

If someone will talk next to you, would you need any effort to hear it?

If a sound happened on the other side of you, you’d also be aware of it without effort, and even if your eyes are closed, you can notice a sense of space all around you.

When I refer to Awareness, I'm pointing to this capacity to notice, that is throughout the body, and all around. And there isn’t really any edge to it or an end to it. And you can notice this all, simultaneously, right now, kinda like on "autopilot".

Where is the "I", that is aware of this sensation...? Where is this "I" located?

I know it's probably a strange question, but a useful one nonetheless, and you can just notice whatever location comes to mind.

It might be somewhere in your head, body, or outside your head or body somewhere.

And what location do you notice?

Another way of experiencing this is asking *“Where is the perceiving happening from?”*

E.g. *"it's in front of me, pretty close, slightly to the right"*
