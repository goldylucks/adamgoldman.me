I never charge for information.

All my content is, and always will be, **100% [free](/i-dont-charge-i-accept), and open sourced, FOREVER**.

By open sourced I mean anyone can [clone the code](https://github.com/goldylucks/adamgoldman.me) of this site, improve it, build upon it, and draw ideas and inspiration from it.

I'm building a ["problem-solving" bot](/tools) that can teach humans to let go of the past, process grief, stop bad habits, and [much more](/transcripts).

If you want to help, great!

If you want to do your own version, feel free to clone the code and do your own thing. I'll even help you.

I'm not competing against anyone. I rally for "team people", and I enjoy seeing more and more people taking a similar path.

My code and content is under the GPLv3 license, meaning you can do with it as you wish, as long as you keep it free and open sourced as well.

Feel free to [share](FB_SHARE) and [use anything](/tools) you find here, as long as your not a dickhead and give credit when it's due ;)
