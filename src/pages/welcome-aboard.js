So ...
You decided to join our little circle eh?

Smart move my friend ;)

**Expect me to knock on your virtual door** every once in a while, **cool stuff guaranteed**. In the meantime, anything else [you want to say](/contactNEW)?

btw, one of my virtual minions might have sent you a quick email to make sure we got the address right, and that you want to get more from [me](/about).

In the meantime, feel free to [play with some of the tools](/tools) and learn from some [case studies](/transcripts).

As you may know all my content is, and forever will be, 100% [free](/i-dont-charge-i-accept) and [open sourced](/open-source), so donâ€™t go opening your wallet just yet, unless you wish to [donate](/i-dont-charge-i-accept), which is always appreciated, tho not necessary for you to enjoy my content :)

Let's keep talking and make it a great day!
