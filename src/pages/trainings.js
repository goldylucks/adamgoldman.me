- **Metaphors of movement** - Andrew T. Austin
  - Even tho I rarely use this specific method, I learned a lot of tricks and insights I incorporated to my [life](/about) and [teachings](/teaching-is-intoxicating-my-greatest-passion-for-20-years)


- **Integral Eye Movement Therapy** (AMT 2009) - Andrew T. Austin

- **Client Session: Weight Loss, Metaphors of Movement** - Andrew T. Austin

---

- **Epistemological Metaphors & Clean Language** - David Grove

- **Forgiving Parents** - Virginia Satir

---

- **[Provocative Change](http://provocativechangeworks.com/products)** - Nick Kemp

- [**Sleight of Mouth**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_DxQ10VBhg&list=PLnxyuZyRlNTTo6ssAfJDDh5mt8FszNyKA) - Robert Dilts
  - Absrob's Robert's charisma and learn a powerful skill at the same time. At the moment it's open on youtube so might as well watch it :)

  - Don't remember where I've seen these videos, but I can't find them now. If you do find them [let me](/contactNEW) know and I'll add the links here.
- **Strategies of Genius** - Robert Dilts
  - If your new to modeling and unconscious assimilation, this will be a good place to start.
  - If your a bit advanced, use your skills to unconsciously model Robert in these videos. See how much of his calming presence you can adopt by merely watching.
  - [Let me know](/contactNEW) if you find it. I've watched this long time ago and did not find it now.
- **The Hero's Journey and the 5 Rhythms** - Robert Dilts & Stephen Giligian
  - It's cute abstract knowledge to paint the background of your inner adventure.
  - Was slow for me to listen, but there's a really high benefit of absorbing the way these guys talk AND complement each other.
  - Can't find the audios. If you do, send me a link.
- **Generative Trance** - Stephen Giligian
  - I've listened to an old audio version and it's ok'ish, but too slow for me for the output given.

---

- [**Blueprint Decoded**](http://partner.blueprintdecoded.com/new/?source=75244) - Owen Cook

---

- [**Jason Silva Life System**](https://www.silvamethod.com) - Jason Silva (and daughters!)
  - Okay this one has some wacky ideas and things to play with your brain. For me NLP is more accurate and powerful, but I do recommend this to gain a new perspective about some of the same ideas.
  - My aunt and yours truly have taught ourselves to wake up in an exact hour without a clock, and healed some physical pains.

  - Rubbish
- [**Unconscious Influence**](www.maxpersuasion.com) - Kenrick Cleveland

- **NLP Techniques Masterclass** - Jamie Smart
  - Boring as fuck. Save your breath, time, and money.

  - Just watch Robert's stuff on Youtube. It's pretty much the same content, but you'll get the added benefits of absorbing Robert's charisma.

- **Conversational Trance: How** - Michael Breen
  - Slow and boring. Bandler for the win.

# Steve Andreas
I've learned so much from this guy ... He likes to work really clean with sub-modalities, and he has such a calm presence. When I was going through some not-so-pleasant times, Watching these videos would calm and soothe me greatly, just by absorbing how he interacts with the world and with the people who come to him for different things. I cannot recommend it enough. If you know of anything of his that is not on this list, [let me know](/contactNEW)!

# Bandler
The man who started it all ... This is a pretty interesting individual with a fucked up story, and his work is brilliant. He's doing so many things at once when he teaches, that it's hard for me to listen to the "normal" old way by others. I've watched all of these multiple times, and I find myself becoming a [better communicator and speaker](/book-me) still.

- [**Rare 1981 Live Seminar**](/blog/bandler-rare-1981) (my notes)
- **Persuasion Engineering - Sales & Business, Language & Behavior**
 - If you are into persuasion, this is for you. And if you are not, this is for you even more. This is the whackiest "sales" course you will ever do ;)
- **Three days in konstanz (200)**
 - Bandler is not at his finest in here, but the content is very interesting. It's what you finally see in the big picture once you get some distance from the little pieces.
- **The Art & Science of Nested Loops**
 - Probably the main reason why Bandler is 10x better than any other instructor out there. It's all one big story with sub plots and twists and before you know it, the information is within you.
- **The class of a master**
- **Trancing in & out**
- **Welcome to Reality**
- **Charisma Enhancement**
 - This is pure gold. I've listened to it many times, and it's one of the courses that makes me want to build a time machine and participate live.
- **State of the art**
- **30 years of NLP**
 - It's one of my least favorite courses of Bandler which I still recommend. 
- **Creating therapeutic change**
 - If you are advanced and have helped 100+ people and get consistent results, this is for you. This is VERY high level training and unless you have great success and confidence in your skills this will be a waste of your money and time.
- **NHR - Neuro Hypnotic Repatterning**
- **Magic in action**
- **Personal Enhancement**
- **DHE - Designed human engineering**

# Paul Mckenna
Started as Bandler's apprentice. He is not so good with a crowd, but his personal trance audios are AMAZING. The best ones I've heard so far (and I tried hundreds ...)

- **Accelerated learning**
 - nice concept BUT he sells himself too much in the tape itself, which I DO NOT appreciate, and stopped listening after a few minutes.
- **Change your Life in 7 Days**
 - This self hypnotic trance is AMAZING. I listen to it a lot and it beams me to the stars.
- **Sleep like a log**
 - One of the only things that helped me when insomnia and I were still friends.
 - There's a newer one, I can make you sleep, which I haven't tried but seem to work better for others by the reviews
- **Success For Life**
- **Positivity**
 - currently on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cPjsHuwwUc
- **Supreme self confidence**
 - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hypnotherapy-Supreme-Confidence-Paul-Mckenna/dp/B00002MVA0
- **Instant confidence**
- **Supreme confidence**
 - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Instant-Confidence-Paul-McKenna/dp/0593055357
 - There's a new one which you can get for free with audible trial - https://www.amazon.co.uk/I-Can-Make-You-Confident/dp/B00HZOBO7W/ref=la_B001H6GIYI_1_16?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1501149264&sr=1-16

# Milton Erickson
One of the early successful recorded hypnotherapists.
I've seen some of his sessions with clients. It's interesting but soooo indirect and slooowwwww ... for example he cures a phobia in 6 sessions, and I've done it [many times](/blog/aprils-bus-phobia) in a few minutes. We have faster & better technology now. Use it!

# Andre chaperon
This guy is such a powerful writer and story teller, I've done each of these courses more than thrice.
