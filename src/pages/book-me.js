Before you read the topics **I sense you* like me just **LOVE presentations**, never reach for the phone during, and thank your maker for oh yet another exhilarating experience.

There are very few people I can actually [listen](TITLE_as_in,_focus,_and_not_doing_anything_else) to without plotting my exit right off the bat, as their move to their second slide.

**Puking information just ain't gonna cut it for me**, even if it's wrapped in a fancy presentation with well aligned slides and bullet points.

![Boring Presentation](${cloudImg('adamgoldman.me/read-from-slides.jpg')})

I'm there to be enthralled.  
Captivated.  
To be moved in a direction.

I want you to suck me in your world and spit me out the other end smarter, richer, and hungry for more.

Might sound very demanding and that's only because it is!

And we should not demand any less, from either side.

When talking to an audience, I'm there to INSTALL the information so YOU won't have to make an effort enjoying learning as the thrill it naturally once was for you.

There are distractions to eliminate, rhythm to synchronize, pitch to tune, and responses to elicit and anchor just as emotions peak and ...

I have to be able to do all that and more so their ass will be mine, otherwise it's MY ass that's gonna be theirs', and even tho we have our differences, we are kinda attached to one other ;)

It's my job to digest the information for you and package it in a way your unconscious now will keep up, as you enjoy and let it just "get learned".

Soup operas rake in the Benjamins NOT because they have [killer plots or scripts](TITLE_and_definitely_not_for_the_acting).

The same reason the [princess survived a thousand nights](http://amzn.to/2txLHZw), it's the degree to which you are able to weave stories and emotions that let's you keep your ass and have theirs eagerly presenting attention for the next piece.
