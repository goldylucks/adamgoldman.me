- [**Getting Things Done**](http://amzn.to/2uLA6Fe) - David Allen
  - How to get [mind like water](/blog/mind-like-water-tartar-sauce) states
- [**Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion**](http://amzn.to/2uM3kDY) - Robert Cialdini
  - This is a master piece! I've read it twice and will make a proper book review when I'll get around to it. It's full of crazy experiments that blew my mind.
- [**Introducing NLP**](http://amzn.to/2uAImcF) - Joseph O'Connor, John Seymour
- [**Heart of Mind**](http://amzn.to/2CfrEVT) - Steve and Connirae Andreas
- [**Transforming Negative Self-Talk: Practical, Effective Exercises**](http://amzn.to/2eVCSno) - Steve Andreas
- [**Tricks Of The Mind**](http://amzn.to/2vkFa5g) - Derren Brown
  - Read it many years ago, now going over it again. If you get fascinated now by how your brain tricks not only others, you will enjoy this!
- [**Looking Forward**](http://amzn.to/2uI9LJE) - Jacque Fresco
- [**Predictably irrational**](http://amzn.to/2uLuryY) - Dan Ariely
- [**The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People**](http://amzn.to/2v6l9jy) - Steven Covey
- [**The Complete Guide To Fasting**](http://amzn.to/2vT48ad) - Dr. Jason Fung
- [**Panic Away**](/blog/panic-away-insiders-view) - Barry McDonagh
- [**Adventures of Anybody**](http://amzn.to/2uLypYt) - Richard Bandler
  - An amazing experience based intro to NLP, how I got started
- [**Mastering Your Hidden Self: A Guide to the Huna Way**](http://amzn.to/2hbxAVK) - Serge Kahili King 
  - I read it many years ago and liked it, but for me NLP works much preciser and effectiver (Yes, I made up that word, if it bothers you, you could definitely benefit from this). It's a nice short read to expand your mind tho. It gets good reviews on amazon.
- [**Get The Life You Want**](http://amzn.to/2vo4wO9) - Richard Bandler
  - Packed with technique to take control and improve your life as YOU desire.
- [**The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature**](http://amzn.to/2hbKfrL) - Harper Perennial
  - Good content but too draggy for me. I got the idea pretty quick and stopped in the middle. The reviews are of the charts tho, so maybe I'll give it a read again sometime soon.
- [**The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem**](http://amzn.to/2v6OElu) - Nathaniel Branden
- [**NLP: The New Technology of Achievement**](http://amzn.to/2vSObkw) - Steve Andreas
  - Haven't read it but got so many recommendations I've put it in. Read some of the amazon reviews before you buy, they are VERY high.
- [**What Every BODY is Saying**](http://amzn.to/2hbaNcJ) - Joe Navarro
  - One of my next reads. The reviews are incredible, and it keeps popping up many places I go.
- [**The Way of the Superior Man: A Spiritual Guide to Mastering the Challenges of Women, Work, and Sexual Desire**](http://amzn.to/2uLSyOd) - David Deida
  - I might read this soon, heard amazing things, and the [amazon reviews](http://amzn.to/2uLSyOd) are of the charts.
- [**The Art Of Seduction**](http://amzn.to/2v66Jjn) - Robert Green
  - Read it long time ago and didn't quite liked it, don't remember why. Incredible reviews tho.
- [**Rich dad poor dad**](http://amzn.to/2v6Pi2o) - Robert T. Kiyosaki
  - Save your time and money, and let me sum it up for you: Make money work for you, you CAN generate passive income, cultivate the mindset of abundance. That will be $4.82 please :)
  - It looks like the majority of the population disagrees with me since it's so freakin' popular, tho you ain't one of 'em majority now are you? ;)
- [**Awaken the Giant Within**](http://amzn.to/2uHVmxl) - Tony Robbins
  - Tony claimed to have "invented" the science of "neuro associative conditioning", but really he just repackaged Bandler's work in a more marketing oriented way. It has insane reviews so what do I know it might change your life (like so many confess), but it's really not my style.
  - I still recommend it to get NLP from a different style.
- [**How to Win Friends and Influence People**](http://amzn.to/2uLACmv) - Dale Carnegie
  - I dropped this one after a few dozen pages. It's like really basic unprecise NLP. Insanely popular and highly reviewed tho.
- [**Art of War**](http://amzn.to/2uLAtjb) - Sun Tzu
- [**Four hour work week**](http://amzn.to/2hbSEv5) - Tim Ferriss
  - Even tho I don't like his writing, the content is solid.
- [**ToT**](http://amzn.to/2hb4LbU) - Tim Ferriss
  - Again, painful writing, good content.
- [**Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind**](http://amzn.to/2v6zug0) - Al Ries, Jack Trout
- [**The Alchemist**](http://amzn.to/2uLGuMT) - Paulo Coelho
  - Read it at 16. The main point of the book is ludicrous, but it has many healthy subtleties.
- [**The Power of Now**](http://amzn.to/2v6zg8B) – Eckhart Tolle
  - Some fluff, but many good metaphors that are beneficial to install in your brain.
- [**A new earth**](http://amzn.to/2w9gxX0) - Eckhart Tolle
  - Like the [power of now]((http://amzn.to/2v6zg8B)), just better.
- [**Brief history of human kind**](http://amzn.to/2hbLQ0B) - Yuval Noah Harari
  - I hate pretty much everything in this book, but the content is INCREDIBLE
- [**The game**](http://amzn.to/2v6xOmJ) - Neil Strauss
- [**The 48 Laws of Power**](http://amzn.to/2uLW62H) – Robert Greene
  - Read it many years ago, don't remember much other than not liking it
- [**Everybody loves you when you are dead**](http://amzn.to/2uLVTfS) - Neil Strauss
- [**The Best That Money Can't Buy**](http://amzn.to/2hbWDI0) - Jacque Fresco
- [**The Definitive Book of Body Language**](http://amzn.to/2uItkSl) - Barbara Pease, Allan Pease
- [**The Irresistible Offer: How to Sell Your Product or Service in 3 Seconds or Less**](http://amzn.to/2v6H36t) - Mark Joyner
- [**Presell Mastery**](http://www.presellmastery.com/book) - Paul Hancox
- [**The Tao of Pooh**](http://amzn.to/2v6MkuO) - Benjamin Hoff
  - Adorable book that sneaks happiness under your radar. Be happy for no reason :)
- [**Habit stacking**](http://amzn.to/2eVDqJY) - S.J. Scott
- [**Come Again**](http://amzn.to/2x4JJhI) - my man Nate ;)
- [**Secrets of Mental Math**](http://amzn.to/2wvXvel) - Arthur Benjamin
  - Growing up I was often beating people with calculators, and got called "the faster than calculator" kid (which landed me extremely popular and many girlfriends as you can not imagine). This book will show you how to do just that.
- [**A Mind for Numbers - How to Excel at Math and Science**](/a-mind-for-numbers) - Barbara Oakley
  - [Read my summary here](/a-mind-for-numbers)
- [**Thinking In Numbers: On Life, Love, Meaning, and Math**](http://amzn.to/2voH1EN) - Daniel Tammet
  - Am halfway through this, having watched "[the boy with the incredible mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPySn3slfXI)" (which is fucking awesome), but the book is, umm, not what I expected. I was looking for mental strategies to think in math, but it's more of a novel autobiography about Daniel's life, a rare savant.
- [**Metaphors We Live By**](http://amzn.to/2vyYBrd) - George Lakoff and Mark Johnson
  - It's sad that school has conditioned people to think labeling stuff is learning. After a 100 pages into this book, I got some new labels for stuff I already knew since I was 10, and I'm not a penny the wiser.
