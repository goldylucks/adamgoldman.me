[Adam](/) here … Glad to have you on board!
(that’s me down there with my stupid teaching grin on my face)

Lemme quickly tell you a bit (or [more](/)) about me, then I’ll give you some idea what we are doing here, I’ll get to know you, we’ll set you up with some new shiny technology, and we’ll get this show and the roll ...

#### A bit about me ...

![Adam Goldman Teaching](${cloudImg('me/with-psu-students')})

I mainly do tech consultancy and dev training to companies and individuals, and a bit of productivity hacks and streamlining workflows.

I focus on full stack JavaScript web development, especially React and Redux, with 7+ years hands on coding, tutoring and team leading experience, delivering production apps utilizing latest technologies and best practices.

I was featured on [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/adamgold) a couple of times and recently founded the [Adam Method](https://www.facebook.com/adamgoldman.me). You can follow me and my shenanigans at the [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/adamgoldman.me) and [Github](https://github.com/goldylucks/).

#### A bit about our time together …

![Rick and morty](${cloudImg('adamgoldman.me/rick-morty')})

This is an apprenticeship. I’m not your boss, and your not my employee. We are exchanging VALUE, not money. 

You will work on some of my projects, and I will improve your code and set you on the right path to become a kick ass developer as fast as possible. In the (not so distant) future I might hire you if we see that we are a good fit for each other and we work well together.

The only thing we “awe” each other is clear, honest communication. I want you to feel you can tell me EVERYTHING that goes through your mind about our time together. 

I’m not a psychic (yet!) so unless you keep me informed, I wouldn’t be able to EFFECTIVELY help you to develop as a person and a programmer, which is why we have gathered here today :)

Now for the important part …

#### I need to get to know YOU

[Message](${MESSENGER_LINK_WELCOME}) me the after you’ve completed this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/fwtHQ08yWjyGJ0hu1).

Now that we know each other, it’s time to …

#### What to do if you get stuck

1. Read the installation instructions carefully again
2. Copy paste the error your getting to google and follow the trail of crumbs
3. Read [how to ask good questions](/blog/how-to-ask-a-good-programming-question/).
4. Ask around with your friends (keep in mind note 3 …)
5. Ask me (keep in mind note 3 …)

**A quick little note about that**: U know how sometimes you find yourself staring at the screen, after a (too long) period of grinding through a problem, only to end up back where you started?

Been there too my friend. It’s not pretty, eh? Those days are OVER for you. That’s what you have me for. Make sure you**get to point 5** up there **BEFORE** the staring at screen stage. 

Mental energy is the jet fuel we fly on. It’s one of our most valuable resources. Keeping it high is more important than solving the current problem at hand.

Now that we got the right tools and mindset in place, let the games begin!

#### General Pointers
1. From this point on, whenever you are around a computer, you NEVER write anything on paper for future reference. You have a computer. Use it! Use a google doc or a simple text document. Heavy programs like word are NOT recommended.
2. Don’t hesitate to ask me ANYTHING. The only stupid question is one that you have on your mind and don’t ask ;)
3. Feel free (and even encouraged) to challenge what you are learning and come up with your own solutions. I’m more experienced than you but it doesn’t mean my solution is the best one.
4. When asking me something, **please** quickly go over "[how to ask...](/blog/how-to-ask-a-good-programming-question/)" again
5. My goal is to make you as self sufficient as possible as fast as possible. Therefor I will often answer your questions with a link or a search query that will lead you to the solution. I’ve found this to be an incredibly powerful way to improve your solving problems, FAST.
6. when you run into a problem, try solving it on your own first, but don't get to the point you are frustrated. contact me before your emotional batteries will determine our success for your growth as a programmer, so pay close attention to them.
7. Remember you learn best when you have fun, so that’s always the #1 goal!

#### Your first mission (if you choose to accept it …)

[Go through the best tutorial](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch) ever created by man. It will set you up to speed with a bad-ass JS stack with most of the latest and greatest technologies. Go through it step by step, and make sure you CODE EVERYTHING BY HAND. 

**Do NOT copy paste!**

It’s hard, I know, but PLEASE trust me on this one. From this point onwards, whenever you are doing a tutorial, write all code by hand. This will give you a different kind of understanding. In a way, your “fingers” learn much faster than you, and there’s a LOT to learn in the crazy lands of web development, so we could use all the help we could get.

Now here’s another BIG tip …

**First write the code**. See the changes in your browser. Make sure it works. only **THEN try to UNDERSTAND it**. It’s much easier for your brain to understand abstract concepts (code) AFTER it has a clear visual representation of what it does (the changes in the browser, the actual app/website)

Remember the process of what to do if you get stuck ^^^

Also remember you do NOT work for me, so there’s no deadline for this. That being said, the sooner you're done with that, the sooner we’ll move on to the good stuff ;)

Keep me posted on your progress!

#### Final words?

Please, please, (pretty please?) if any question or comment about our work together pops up, [shoot](/lets-talk/) it [my](/about/) way. If anything is bugging you, I NEED TO KNOW so I could best help you. Okie dokie?

Real glad to have you on board, and I’m curious to see how fast u’ll be amazed from your progress and the cool projects you will help bring to life.
