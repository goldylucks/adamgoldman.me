Most of what we’ll do together is content free, meaning I do NOT need the details of your experience, so you get total privacy.

For example, if we are sofetning a past memory, I don't need the details of your memory, just a title for reference, i.e. "at the gym" is enough for me, as long as YOU know what memory it refers to.

Needless to say (but here I go saying it anyways, just in case ...), **EVERYTHING in our interaction stays between us**. Whatever you write or say to me, stays only with me, unless you explicitly state otherwise.

I don’t share anything with anyone, no matter how close to me that person is, and how much I trust them. Privacy is SACRED. No one will even know we’ve worked together.
