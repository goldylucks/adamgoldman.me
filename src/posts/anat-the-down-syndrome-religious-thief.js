That was my first (and only so far, sadly …) time helping someone with down syndrome. I did not know quite what to expect …

This tiny little lady is in her late 30’s, living with her parents, in a very religious Jewish house.

I didn’t have much time with her (about 30 minutes if memory serve), and it was enough for both of us to understand what was going on.

On the surface, her problem was compulsive thievery.

Everywhere she went, she took stuff without paying from stores and people around her. The “weird” part was that she usually left her “prizes” in places she knew mommy and daddy would find.

She’s been to different kind of professional therapy for years and had no idea why she keeps doing that.

20 minutes and a few interesting Q&As later, her face suddenly lit up, and she slipped into a deep trance (in the most adorable way) …

Anat: *Yes because of course I will steal. I will take things and then people will find out and THEY will have to deal with it*

By THEY, as it turns out, she refers to mom and paps, which apparently suffocate her and rule her life, down to the tiniest of parts.

Being a good Jewish daughter, she ought to “respect thy father and mother”, so defying them DIRECTLY or standing up for herself was not an option.

Ana: *Oh wow … I … But I am a good daughter … I don’t want to steal … I don’t want to say no to my parents … But this is my way to show them ... They deserve it!*

She poured a few more minutes about this, and proceeded to say she’s never seen it so clearly before.

To fully resolve this situation I need to see her AND more importantly, her parents, both of which I had no time for, as I was leaving Israel at the time.

Her therapist updates me from time to time, saying she keeps mentioning our time together and asks when do I return.

No operational results this with Anat, tho was an interesting time indeed.
