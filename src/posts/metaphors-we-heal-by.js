From all methods I've learned and practiced of effective personl change, this is the most "wtf is going on" one I've experienced.

I've used it many times with fantastic results, as you can read here:
 - [Healing Metaphors - Water & Slime](/blog/healing-metaphors-water-slime/)

If you have any experience with this type of work, do [let me know](FB_MESSAGE) and add your comment below, so we can all learn from each other.

I want to add more details about this course by Mr. David, tho life has a tendency of getting in the way, you know how it is ;)
