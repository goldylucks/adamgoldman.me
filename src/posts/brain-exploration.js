[This is not](/blog/what-we-are-not-doing/) therapy, I'm not a therapist, nor do I ever wish to be, as when I was still down in the past, insomniac, in pain and depressed,
I did not find any of them to be useful,
and I've talked to hundreds of "professionals" ...

<br />

what we are about to do is all [100% open](/i-dont-charge-i-accept/) and natural for you to [learn and experience](/tag/experience-based-learning/),
and here's how it's going to work,
as I've been studying human behavior, organisms,

how society shapes behavior, communication,
and the greatest learning machine of all,
the human brain,

I'm going to give you some things to try, and

[whatever works](/transcripts/) for you, you get to keep,
whatever doesn't you file away in the

"thing's I've tried and haven't worked for me yet."

Content is not needed, you get to keep your privacy and change it too.

[I](/about/) do not need to know the specific details to [induce a powerful long lasting change](/transcripts/).

The main reason this is so [effective](/transcripts/) is we are playing with internal representations here, [NOT logic and insights](/blog/what-we-are-not-doing/).

We are going after sensory experience, which is how your brain processes and stores information at the neurological level.

You can do this,
and more,
[I got your back](/about/)
