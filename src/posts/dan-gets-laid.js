Dan: *"There's also this other thing you might be able to help me with ..."*

AG: *"Yes ... ?"*

So turns out our friend Dan here was in a deep relationship for almost two years, and lately things were going not so well for the lovely couple.

They were going to couple's counseling for the past three month, and barely kissed or touched each other.

Dan: *"I don't want to break up. I still love her, and like how she looks, but I'm not attracted to her like I used to, even tho "logically" I know I "should" be.*

*I see her in a different way than before"*

Jackpot my friends.
Dan has shown us the way.

AG: *"Don't want to break up, and you want to see her in the same way as before, and feel attracted."*

Dan: *"Exactly"*

AG: *"And your sure you were attracted to her in before?"*

Dan: "*Oh yea, definitely!*"

AG: *"I'm sure you do! And how do you know that? When you think about her today your not. Yet when you go back and think about her like before, you do feel the attraction right? So what's the difference?"*

Dan: *"Well ... let's see ... when I think about her now, she's right there at my face, point blank, and there's no space for anything else. But before it was different. I kinda like see myself in those memories, looking at her, and it attracts me to 'be that guy'. I want to step into that picture. isn't it weird?"*

AG: *"The mind works in mysterious ways my friend :) Now, looks like you have it all figured it out. U know how to be attracted to her. you just forgot to do it lately.*

*So let's try something. Think about her now, and see yourself in the image, just like the ones u've seen before.*"

His pupils started dilating and a few moments later a smile began spreading across his face.

AG: *"That's right, now, keep playing that scene, and in a moment something is about to happen, and you will know when it does."*

His breathing got heavier and faster while his face got red, and after a few minutes he looked at me and said:

Dan: *"That was real something! I saw myself with her, and felt this 'pull' growing harder, as if I've being gravitated towards that scene. And the more I played the scene the harder the pull, until at some point I 'stepped' into myself in the image and was fully there. I really want to see her now!"*

The next day he sent me a thank you message after they had sex, after 3 month of conventional couple therapy and not even a kiss.

U gotta love it when it works :)
