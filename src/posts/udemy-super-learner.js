I've watched the entire thing in x2 speed, it's for you if your new to speed reading and improving memory.

Here's the gist of it:

#### When learning something through reading, audio, video, whateva:
- **Get curious** and think about applications for the material
- **Markers**
  - Create visually strong markers for stuff you want to remmeber
  - Make them vivid and emotional as possible.
     - "soft violet velvet pillow, so fluffy and gentle to the touch, with unique stiches" is better than "pillow"
  - Usually objects work better than verbs
     - "basketball" is better than the verb "playing"
     - "My brother smiling" is better than the abstraction "joy"
  - Answers are better than questions
     - if there's a question and answer paragraph, make the marker the answer. it's easier to reverse enginner the problem from the solution (like solving a maze btw)
  - if the markers can be connected to each other it's better
     - If the basketball suddenly shoots in the air and lands on your mothers face, thinking about the basketball will lead to thinking about dear mama.
- **Review** markers for a few seconds **after each chapter**

#### Increasing reading speed 
- **never go back** on text!
- [**Preread**](https://www.thoughtco.com/prereading-definition-1691529) the chapter to get the gist of it
- **Aim for** 600-1200 WPM
- [**spreeder**](https://www.spreeder.com/) (DO NOT BUY)
  - I don't use it, but they recommend it to pace yourself
  - Even if you like the idea, there are plenty of free alternatives in the web that do EXACTLY the same.
- **Phases**
  - move on to next phase when comprehension reaches 50-60%. Of coure comprehension is an elusive anstract word, so good luck with that, it's just an indicator :)
  - phase 1 - 250 wpm
  - phase 2 - 350 wpm
  - phase 3 - 500 wpm
  - phase 4 - 700 wpm
  - phase 5 - 1000 wpm
  - phase 6 - 1250 wpm
  - phase 7 - 1500 wpm
- **Remember** [Mario's quote](/quotes-i-love/)
- **Plateau hack**
  - If your stuck on 500 wpm, read a few pages at 1500 wpm
  - Reread the same pages at 1500 wpm for a few times
  - And then go to 600 wpm

#### Misc
- **Deeper and longer understanding** for a specific subject
  - Mind mapping
  - Memory palace/temple
  - Memorize numbers with stories and marker system
  - Meh. I use the [this system](http://www.memorizeeverything.com/core_skills/numbers/) instead
- **Sleep**
  - Healthy sleep is importnat (you don't say ...)
  - Naps
  - Practicing learning faster and deeper can drain you at times.
  - Memory/power naps can help, up to 26 minutes (otherwise we get into deep sleep)
- **State based learning**

  - If u'll have a test in a noisy place, study in a noisy environment
  
- [Coffee](/blog/coffee/) is okay!

- [Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)

- dense material (law, medicine, etc)
  - emphasis on pre read, creating curiousity and think about applications for the material

#### Languages
- Classroom is a terribly inefficient place to learn
- Don't translate words, connect to direct sensory experience
- Learn in the real word, real scenarios
- Use [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and upload images to words

#### Remember names
- Link to another person you know with same name
- Notice what stands out in the person and tie the name to that
- Nonenglish names, break to words
  - Samoon -> Sam + Moon

#### Limiting beliefs
Many people who read this page tell me it's sounds good BUT they will never make it because ...
- "I'm not smart enough"
- "I'm diagnosed with ..."
- "That's true for OTHERS, but it will never work on me ..."

... If your one of said people, fret not!

[do this first](/tools/internal-dialog-scrambler/), and [talk to me](/lets-talk/)!

Should you [buy it](https://www.udemy.com/become-a-superlearner-2-speed-reading-memory-accelerated-learning/)? If some of those concepts are new to you, and you prefer to save time researching them yourself, I'd say go ahead and buy it. I got very limited benefits from this course but I've been into speed learning for years now, so if your new, check it out.

The dude presenting the course seems sweet and genuine, trying to be professional and "human" at the same time, which always gets a giggle out of me (u know by now [how "professional" and "serious" I can get](/about/) at times ...)
