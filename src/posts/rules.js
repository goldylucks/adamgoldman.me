- toilet paper side - A

- Adam is always right

- if you don't agree with rule 2, consider who was here first

- abbrevations are awesome, can u b the one who c that btw?

- ambiguities are even awesomer, as odd as it sounds, if you see my . by the way I like you to like me too

- awesomer is a word

- wrong is a wrong thing to say, since there's no right or wrong, only more and less accurate

- so what's left is the right direction to take

-you can't be seriously taking yourself just a tidy bit lighter?

- remember that some lighters are lighter than others, and ambiguities are awesome

- all human beings deserve love

- the sadistic individual who designed the airlines checkin program should be shot and killed, by a sweet blind noun, in a loving manner

- you, like me, love to be lazy at times, which is probably why you're reading this list as you know you should GET BACK TO DOING SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE

- bananas are god's finest creation for us lazy people, altho I get driven by nuts oftener

- if awesomer is a word, oftener is one as well, and that's a deep thought

- (do you wonder about how deep that well is, or reflected upon how awesome ambiguities r, again?)

- "rules are made to be broken" - said the worst lawyer ever

- if one and one and one is three, WTF does that got to do with being good looking?

- see I told you abbriviations are awesome (WTF is that about anyway?)

- the beatles are a living proof that HOW you say stuff matters more than WHAT said stuff r

- the beatles are a living proof that your voice can echo through dimensions long after your dead

- proofs are way overrated, just like those 4 british dudes who reduced themselves to bug status

- pick a number between 1-10. Got it? Good. Now go talk to a human being instead of playing nubmer games with a web page. Da faq is wrong with you anywayz?

- pick a card. any card. Hold it with your mind. Hold it ... Steady ... take a selfie of you holding something with your mind and go be the greatest celebrety magician who ever lived. remember who was there for you before you got famous

- I'll be there for you, like I've been there before. I'll be there for you, cuz your rich and famous now and I want a piece of that (which we both agree I deserve)

- by now you should buy my stupid ambiguity ebook, now, for $7, before I might write it and the price will soar to $7.01 (it's still a steal, and have many ambiguities like this one!)
