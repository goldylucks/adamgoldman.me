Some time ago **an interesting guy asked me** why [can't](/blog/what-we-are-not-doing/) I just explain to him now **what** exactly **is it that we "do"**, that induces **such a [rapid change](/successes/)** in people's behavior and feelings.

Having a near death experience would help to understand, **as the king will testify**, being hidden in the basement by the Abel Black Smith, as enemy troops swept through the town.

As they searched through the house, he knew his time has come, and "**Well, this is it**, said the voice inside.

It could have been [better](/tools/feel-good-generator/), but it matters not now.

Your moments in this dimension are numbered and quickly fading.

As you dwell in the good times you had, and all the positive possibilities you brought to so many people,
who will forever treasure you, let you be known as the one who
even at the darkest times, had a smile on his face,
feel more love, freedom, and happiness as your captures would ever feel."

As expected, and the hidden door to the basement slowly opened, he heard an unexpected whisper ...

"they are gone, your safe, you can open your eyes now"

As the years went by, and the king regained control over the land, Abel's curiosity ate him from the inside ...

"My king, how did you feel in the basement, as you hear enemy soldiers swooping through above, knowing your end is near?"

The king was furious ...

"HOW DARE YOU?!?

Just because you hid me,
DOES NOT give you permission,
to ask,
your king,
such a personal question,

And as the third star will rise to our night's sky,
u will have your final words,
as the bullets of my troops pierce through your flesh ..."

...

And indeed,
as the third star's light shined through the sky's night,
and the black sheet placed upon his head,
as Abel slips into a state we could only dream of now,
the king commanded ...

"Raise your weapons!"

As the firing squad locked and loaded their weapons ...

*chik-chik*

...

The king sneaked behind Abel and yelled,

"FIRE!",

as he pulled the black sheet over his head.

"Does this answer your question my friend?"

The interesting guy slept into a lovely trance and I whispered

"That's right now close your eyes and feel good, as you begin to
realize how fast can you change the way you feel to learn to learn about
changing what it is that you do not know yet, you will be surprised,
as this is only the beginning, and it only gets faster and more intense every time that ..."

I wonder how many of those you"get" now as ...
