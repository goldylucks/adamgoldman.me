I love good questions,

BUT ...

and that's a BIG but

(Like mine, which is [my](/about) least favorite body part btw, we do not get along ...)

do not try to UNDERSTAND before you EXPERIENCE how your about to change, as

**Asking "why" should I open my eyes is not the right question** for Cheryl to ask, but if she doesn't know "how" yet, then asking is a MUST.

Sheryl's 31 birthday was around the corner, and all her loved ones chipped in to pay for the experimental eye surgery she just went through.

It seemed promising, and if lady fortuna is on our side, she would be able to see for the first time in her life.

Over the years many loved ones and experts have gone to great length to try
and describe to her what this "seeing" thing really is,
how the world "looks like", and how blue is different than white.

As the doctor unveiled her face, and unwrapped the last band-aid,
she opened her eyes and broke down crying ...

"This is more than I have ever imagined ..."

I'm inviting you to get curious about those magical moment your about to experience as you open your eyes and see "colors" for the first time in many different ways.

Questions are good, but if Cheryl waited until she understands what blue is BEFORE she opened her eyes, she would have never done so, and remained blind forever.

If you want to get the final nudge about this, [let the king](/blog/the-executed-king/) further open your eyes
