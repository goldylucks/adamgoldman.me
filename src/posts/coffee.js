I'm used to seeing stacks of black bottomed mugs as I walk around different offices, especially around startups and high tech peeps.

For most humans who go crazy for this brown nectar it's a guilty pleasure cuz like many [misconceptions](/blog/common-misconceptions/) that still float around, it's "common knowledge" that **coffee is bad right**?

This is one of those cases where it feels so good to be wrong :)
