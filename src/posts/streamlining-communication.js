- (9) *Father sent the details of the event through whatsapp*
- (7) *Father whatsapped the details of the event*
- (4) *Father whatsapped event's details*

Saved more than half!
Which we can streamline to
saved over half!

We can add some good feelings and STILL save:

- (6) "Father whatsapped event's details, I'm thrilled!"

Or side step for:
- (5) "Father whatsapped event's details. thrilled!"

so we save one more word here but in this case there's more than just saving words.
The actual meaning shifts, and you might prefer to sneak in the *I'm thrilled* in there, but if you leave the "thrilled" hanging like this, it could refer to the other person as well.
That's why you might read this last part again, because sometimes ambigous communication is useful, especially when good feelings are involved.

Would you rather explore "how much happiness" can you feel, or "how much good feelings" you can feel.

Basically that's what I'm telling you to do. Trying many different things while wondering which and how good you will feel while doing so.

you can revert back to the old painfuly long one, *Father sent the details of the event through whatsapp*, but admit it, even reading it again now made you impatient!
(some of you even went "c'mon, out with it!")
(some of you even went "yea yea")
I would go for trying them all out, and then gauge which experience I like the best, and what leads 

It's possible to look for a reason to feel good about the conversation, 
and even more possible to have good feeling AS the reason, and communicate THAT to others.

But it's only possible after you explored them all, which the faster you'll do, the faster you'll streamline more than your outside communication.

The best way to streamline communication is to explore how good you can feel while communicating it to others, 

We can save time AND make more good feeling at the same time, 
but this is your life here, dammit!


So do you think I've earned the favor?

I'm not sure which one you prefer:
- *on communication and good feelings*
- *Feeling better with less*
- *Feel better for less*
- *Say less, feel better*
- *Say less, feel better, you will* - yoda
(TODO:: survey of the above)

if any, over the current headline you already read.

I'm still on the fence regarding three of them.
