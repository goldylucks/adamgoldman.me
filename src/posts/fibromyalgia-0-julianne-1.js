# Notes from the session
You are about to see my notes about the first 20 interventions we've done, over the course of 11 days, followed by a complete unedited word by word transcript of the conversation.

I want you to notice the general background feeling of the interaction, as you go through this. The "11" interventions are powerful on their own, but it's not as powerful as me doing this entire session as one long induction, in which I clearly set the frame of me having control and that as long as she continues to do what I say, her problems WILL be over, and there's just no two ways to go about it.

I will write a dedicated post for frame control later on, but for now just notice the ongoing "tone" I'm setting here.

This is something I'm harping on with many of my students and colleagues. The client needs to KNOW and feel ONE HUNDRED PERCENT that there's just no way I'm going to let her stay the same way. It's just not an option.

Let's begin ...

Right out the gate she preframes our work for me:  
**JB**: *My dad once said to me as a child the mind has great control over the body when I was poorly as a youngster. I'm willing to try anything.*

and continues to give much information about her past:  
**JB**: *I was bullied, raped, excluded from friendship, labled a lier, my dad had a heart attack. Quite a bit around that time*

### Intervention #1 - Relieving memory of the rape at 15
I ask her to choose the first thing she wants to work on, in a very specific way, the highly presuppoes success. I come off so strong since she already said she will try anything AND the she has a deep belief from childhood about the power of the "mind":

**AG**: *so let's start with something simple*  
*... Think about one memory that **still** bothers you* - presupposing it won't in the future  
*... and you will feel better now that you are about to learn to feel better about it* - embedded command (feel better now), followed by another presupposition she will solve this (you are about to learn) and another embeded comman (feel better about it) 

She chooses the rape and the accusations of "asking for it / lying":  
**JB**: *I'll start with the lier thing. That hurt more than the trauma in some ways. Craving support and help when people turned their backs and supported the person who attacked me. Remember sitting by a lake feeling desperate. Writing poems and trying to make sense of it all I feel so bad for that girl.*

Notice she ends with dissociation (*I feel so bad for that girl*), and I enforce that:

**AG**: *that's good you have this separation* - Enforcing and pacing where she is now  
*... it means the hard part u've already done on your own,* - Presupposing SHE has the power AND it's gonna be a smooth sailing from here  
*... without even realizing* - this is a seed for later on, to warm her up to the idea she has more power than she is aware of.  
*... let's first only focus on the attack itself okay?* - This is not a must, and I could have opt for processing the rape AND the social judging, which I usually do in face to face sessions.

I then have her use do the [trauma relief](/tools/trauma-relief/) [tool](/tools/) on just the rape incident itself. At the time the [tool](/tools/) was "in diapers", and didn't include some important framing, so I walked her thru that myself.

Success was evident:

**JB**: *Blimy, that's very interesting! The colour I got was very significant*  
*... Certain moments flashed back* - Indicating the brain learned a better process than repressing those moments  
*... Saw his intent from the start which I have never seen before* - These kinds of spontaneous conclusions often happen when shifting perceptual positions  
*... And then when I focused on how I felt after I felt good from in my chest. And It felt green like fresh morning grass. Bright as a green go sign. Positive and new. Which feels good. But very strange.*

No matter how many times I've done this, I'm always amazed when someone learns to actually feel GOOD about something that just a few minutes ago was percieved as severe trauma.

**AG**: *now as you think about that same memory again how do you feel? what's different?* - presupposing something IS different

**JB**: *Yes very strange. I feel good. Its like it wasn't what it was?*

**AG**: *do you want me to revert you back to your old feelings?*

**JB**: *No way lol I like this*

By saying "no" to this seemingly obvious question, she unconsciously accepts 3 presuppositions that the problem is in the past:
- revert
- back
- old feelings

And there's also another (MUCH more impactful) presupposition she accepts here, that all this is HER FEELINGS, meaning it's not about the event itself, it's her reaction to the event.

This is what many spiritual teachers try to pass on to their students, usually with limited results since they offer it cognitively, which [I have not found](/blog/what-we-are-not-doing/) to be as powerful.

Now compare it to what she's experiencing here ...

She's in a profound altered state. She's actually feeling good thinking about the memory of her being raped at age 15, which most people couldn't comprehend without proper training. She went from 23 years of trauma, straight into good feelings in less than 10 minutes, and here I am asking her if she wants to go back to the way it was.

Since her Amygdala is hyper active, and she's juiced up with all these emotions, any learning that takes place will be highly impactful and long lasting.

And of course she will say no to this seemingly obvious question, thus accepting all those presuppositions straight into the unconscious and long term memory.

Sneaky stuff eh? ;)

I use it a LOT which is DEVESTATINGLY powerful, and if you work with people in this way, PLEASE DO IT as well.

It also adds to the playfulness and easy-going-ness of the overall interaction, which is always good. Some people think changes should be "serious", long, and painful. That hasn't been my experience.

### Intervention #2 - Building want and anticipation for the future
I leverage  that state to build want and anticipation towards a brighter future after the "condition" will be "cured", using hypnotic patterns.

**AG**: *ha! Isn't it interesting*  
*I wonder if you already begin to wonder*  
*how curious you become now*  
*as you think of this moment*  
*not too far from now*  
*where you already learned how to turn more and more things*  
*that used to bother you*  
*to this new*  
*pretty incredible feeling*  
*comical even*  
*how awesome is that?*  

Some of what's going on in this part:
- I start with a question (isn't it interesting) and continue to a packed statement
- Compounding open ended possibilities to overload her cognitive mind
- *wonder* - sementically packed word, implying childhood, fairy tales and playfullness. Also sounds like "wander", which adds to the open endedness.
- *as you think of this moment* - double meaning, could be now or as connected to the next sentence, "not too far rom now"
- *where you already learned* - presupposing she is about to learn, it's only a matter of time, AND that it's something to be learned, and not some "condition" from the outside
- *used to bother you* - presupposing it won't bother her in the future
- *to this new pretty incredible feeling* - double meaning, "this" could refer to her current feeligns or the future ones
- *how awesome is that* - presupposing the future WILL be positive, and it's just a matter of HOW positive she can make it

**JB**: *It is very awesome. And I didn't think it would be possible.*

This is gold. There are many ways to change and install operational positive beliefs, which I will dedicate a post about in the future.

By far, I've found the simplest way to do so is thru impactful direct experince, like turning what seemed to be traumatic, to a source of strength.

I proceed to stack more positivity towards the future:

**AG**: *did you know you are going to feel so good about this* - pointing out again how she can feel good without expecting it  
*just a few moments ago* - Pointing out the polarity between how she "just was" before to how she feels now  
*I wonder what else you can begin to wonder, as you wander around these good feelings, about what it is that is possible for you now, that you know what you know*

In that last sentence there are a few things going on. I'm inviting her unconsciously to generate possibilities about the future WHILE FEELING GOOD, and presupposing again SHE IS IN CONTROL ("*now that you know what you know*).

I've found one of the ways peole so successfully get themselves in a rot is thinking about the future while feeling bad and powerless, which is a good way to make sure you make bad decisions, which induce more bad feelings, and so it goes ...

She responds rather positively:

**JB**: *And I've tried so many times to play it back, make sense of it. See whether I did make it happen if it was my fault. If I remember it right. To suddenly feel this way is incredible ... And yes. The possibilities now seem quite wonderous ... It's a wonderful feeling Adam. Like you say not only a feeling though. It's like a liberation and excitement cause the possibilities of this are pretty endless! You have found something here I believe. Thank you!*

Later that day she reports interesting progress ...

**JB**: *Dunno how or why but I have a spring in my step. My minds working fast. I feel excited. This is highly unusual for me. I'm often bed bound feeling like I'm dying. Today has been a good day. If your about I'll message tomorrow 🙂 thank you again.*


### Intervention #3 - Relieving memory of finding dead godfather

I first make sure to separate potential grief from the traumatic experience itself, then prcoeed to relief the trauma.

**JB**: *Next one that comes to mind is finding my god father dead at my home while I was caring for him.*

**AG**: *there are two different things in here ... do you miss him also? and have feelings of loss when you think of him?*

**JB**: *No. He abused me as a child.*

Even tho she points to the abuse, that does not mean there's no caring, and since I'm not there to read her non-verbal cues and tonality, I make one more check with slight humor:

**AG**: *so that's mainly the memory itself of seeing him dead? you don't go like "poor god father ... I wish he would still be with me"*

**JB**: *There's a lot of mixed up feelings. I cared. But I don't feel loss.*

**AG**: *okay so run the same process*

...

**JB**: *I had to do that twice. Didn't work first time. But I feel good now 🙂*

This is a great indicator of her taking control over her life. Most people would not do it again, and instead tell me something like "it didn't work", expecting me to solve the situation for them.

**AG**: *excellent so now when you think of that memory, what happens? any of the old feeling left?*

Always stacking presuppositions, it's HER FEELING that matters, not the sitation itself, AND these are old feelings.

**JB**: *No. No old feeling. I feel good. All I can think of is me comically jumping throwing tea in the air*

**AG**: *LOL*

**JB**: *I was holding a tray of tea and toast lol*

**AG**: *wasted a good tea? AND a toast? have you no shame? what a terrible loss!*  
{Laughing out sticker here}  
*u mentioned he abused you? notice what happens as you think of that now*  
*u might still need to do the proces* - presupposing it's either resolved or on the way for being resolved
*or is it 100% automatic already?* - again presupposing it's either totally autoamtic or on the way for being so

**JB**: *Oh actually you're right. It's like that was nothing?*

**AG**: *lol I think you're broken :P* - more silliness

**JB**: *Lol Oops. Sorry not sorry lol* - she goes along with it

**AG**: *u sure you don't want me to revert you back to your old behaviors? lol* - you know the impact of this by now ;)

At this point the rest of her past traumas "flipped" to good feelings, as her brain generalized the learning. This is one of faster cases I encountered of someone learning so fast to generalize changes in this magnitude.

**AG**: *try to find any experiences* - try presupposes failure  
*that **used** to bother you* - presupposes it's in the past  
*before what you learned* - it's all about knowing what to do, not the experiences themselves  
*notice what happens we want to be thorough here 🙂*

**JB**: *Everything feels much better. How strange.*

**AG**: *lol you really have no idea how much more is on the way* - building more desire and curiousity for a brighter future

**JB**: *It's kinda freaky. But it's good*

**AG**: *it is, isn't it?*

Notice how I keep the frame of "everything is great" even tho she uses words that could go either way like "how strange" and "it's kinda freaky". Like I said in the intro, the client needs to know that no matter what happens, she WILL get better.

### Intervention #4 - Intensify good feelings
Sent her to do the [good feelings generator](/tools/feel-good-generator/).

**JB**: *Got interrupted by the door twice pfft. So took me a while to get back in the zone but I persisted. That was really good! I chose excitement.* - This is brilliant. Julliane's initiative and proactivity are quite remarkable. She won't let anything stand in her way, and that's exactly where you want clients to be.

*It's a good motivator. And when you feel so low on energy and in pain it's so hard to get motivated. So I wanted more 🙂* - Another great sign. her lack of motivation actually motivated her to want more. She connected the tool on her own to the solution to low energy and pain.

### Intervention #5 - Relieving anxiety

**AG**: *did you tell me about panic / anxiety? not sure if it was you*  
I was working with about a dozen of people at the time, from depression, OCD and fibro groups, so wasn't sure who told me about what.

**JB**: *i suffered badly with depression about a year ago, with anxiety and feelings of panic.*

**AG**: *so right now can you feel anxiety?* - presupposing it's something SHE CAN DO, she has the power.

**JB**: *I can push it away feeling the way I do at the moment*

This is an attempt on her part to get over the anxiety which most people do. Because she is not conscious of HOW she generates the anxiety, she tries to overcome it by pushing "it" away. Probably "it" means she is pushing away the picture in her mind that makes her anxious. This provides some momentarily relief, but it's not a long term solution, so I elicit her internal strategy for making the anxiety:

**AG**: *is it a picture in your mind of something? teach me how to make this feeling so do I need to make a picture of myself? or I say stuff to myself?*

Notice also this elicitation presupposes again that this is something she is DOING, as oppose to something that just happens to her.

She describes a vivid internal movie, so I have her run the [trauma relief tool](/tools/trauma-relief/) on it, which works the same way on constructed scenarios.

**JB**: *it's like bright lights of good stuff coming out from where I expected something awful to come from*

**AG**: *bright lights of good stuff lol I created an ecstasy junkie! how will I live with myself 😞oh lord, pardon me for my sins ...*

I add more playfullness and silliness, and continue to solidify the change:

**AG**: *so no more anxiety? are you going to miss it?*

By saying "no", she unconsciously accepts the presupposition the anxiety does not exist in her future. This is a covert way of future pacing by implication, which very rarely get resistance.

**JB**: *No. Thinking about how it goes just gets scrambled by pleasure and I feel good. Mental*

**AG**: *lol you were suppose to teach me how to get panic* - solidifying the idea she was always in control, actively making the panic  
*not turn it into more good feelings!* - presupposing there are more good feelings other than this one  
*I'm gonna have to give you an "F" in brain control* - more silliness


### Intervention #6 - Turning all negativity to good feelings
**AG**: "so thinking of anxiety make you feel good now huh how about depression? don't tell me that's gone too??" - more laughter and silliness

**JB**: *It's hard to think about anything negative right now? I feel good 🙂*

**AG**: *that's exactly the time to try in vain to feel bad* - double presupposition she will fail ("try", "in vain")  
*think of stuff that used to make you feel bad in the past* - double presupposition it's in the past (used to, in the past)

**JB**: *Lol it's not working. You broke the button for me.*

**AG**: *this is the perfect time to connect more good feelings to old limitations worst case scenario you will find more things to turn into bright lights of pleasure*

Notice how I set it up as a positive double bind. I have her make a thorough scan of her past, with the KNOWING that no matter what she will "find" in this internal scan, it's positive.

Up until the day before she was being ruled by her past, and now she is jumping into it HOPING to find more bad feelings to turn into good ones. This is powerful as it is sneaky, and it's one of the learnings I install in most my clients and students.

**JB**: *Same things happening to most stuff. They are many wavy lines of light moving towards me from the thing/situation I'm thinking about all different colours.* - This is a fantastic reaction. She's already in light synsteshia.

**AG**: *and many wavy lights moving towards you ... and different colours!* - clean hypnotic language to intensify her experience  
*I wonder if u've thought what colorful lights can smell like or perhaps you already hear the sound they do, and the sound of the feeling?* - eliciting synsteshia of sound and/or smell

**JB**: *Hmm smell of burning incense silent and fast* - that's impressive! she got smell, sound and speed

**JB**: *... It's all turned into pleasure. What did you do hahahaha I could sit here and do this all day 😛* - seems like it's working :)


### Intervention #7 - Recoding life with the new good feeling
I have her intensify the feeling while going to her earliest memory, and go through her entire life with this feeling, and stack any good feeling she finds along the way.
 
**JB**: *All went by in quick moving smoky journey. Stopping at stages filling each up the same feeling.*  
*I actually found myself gasping at some points*  
*lol*  
*mental*  
*How can my Brain do this.*  


### Intervention #8 - Future pacing / recoding rest of life with the new good feeling
I have her do the same thing this time for the future

**JB**: *Well minds blown up now lol is it weird I'm no longer feeling satisfied to just have the things I previous wanted for my future? Like before I set my aims simply and achievable. Now my mind goes wild thinking past the limitations? Or am I just seeing what I wanted but better than I ever wanted? Is that good for me? It feels strange to think that way.*


### Intervention #9 - Intensifying pleasure and good emotions in the present

**AG**: *in your wildest dreams you expected to* - Samentically packed word "wildest"
*feel so good* - embedded command in the question
*about so many things?* - open ended invitation for her unconscious to notice all the things she feels good about

Most people never get close to their dreams, and I'm pointing her to the fact she just went way beyond her wildest ones, while still inducing trance AND building want and anticipation for the future.

**JB**: *No. I didn't in my wildest dreams ever think I could feel so good about everything*

**AG**: *and yet here you are doing it* - Again pointing her breakthrough
*and more!* - Implying there's more but not stating it, inducing trance by having her go inside and search more "good stuff"
*by trying new things* - In all my clients I install this opeartional belief that trying new things is GOOD

**AG**: *where in your physical body do you feel the best now the most vibrant with life and health? which part of your body feels the most young and fresh?*

Since she still had physical pain, from this point of the session I'm starting to plant seeds of health and leverage good feelings to propel her towards a healthy life, while at the same time pointing towards youth, which is BEFORE she was diagnosed, i.e. she is perfectly healthy.

**JB**: *it's kinda right in my core. In my tummy I guess.* - This is gold my friend! "core" is much deeper and powerful than any body part, a wonderful metaphor I'm now going to utilize many times.

**AG**: *in your core ... and what do you feel most in your core and fresh? vibrant? alive? health?*

**JB**: *Buzzing* - Now we have a metaphor of good feelings ABOUT the metaphor of location, depth and level of the body, and I'm going to utilize that as well from this point onwards.

**AG**: *Buzzing ... how interesting isn't it ? and can buzzing spread when it's buzzing in core or it flows first to the rest of you*

**AG**: "and can buzzing spread when it's buzzing in core or it flows first to the rest of u" - Inducing further trance and eliciting stronger buzzing

**JB**: *Yes its like spread through me, and like it could spread from me. It's still there even though I'm now sat having a cuppa being less focussed*

Remember the frame of my sessions, everything a client says is GOOD and CAN be utilized, so don't be alarmed by "less focused":

**AG**: *and it's still there ... and how strong is someone ... who even when not focused...  has buzzing health in core ... spreading through and from ... on autopilot*

Lemme point again how much it's KEY to be in trance when doing this kind of work. This sentence flew right out of my fingers without conscious thinking, and I would NOT have come up with it otherwise. The more you surrender to the process, the more powerful your sessions.

**JB**: *I'd never have guessed that could be me*

This is an indication about her PAST limitation. It's easy to fall into the logic trap here and start to tear apart the "deep meaning" of what this might mean, but instead I let her unconscious and feeling lead her, it's MUCH quicker and powerful than logically talkign about it:

**AG**: *and how does it feel now* - Since I know she's bathed in good chemicals and emotions, I'm leading with feelings  
*to feel it is you* - Embedded command + pointing her she's breached her past limitations (her past sentence)  
*and inside of your core* - Utilizing her own metaphor for the level of change  
*and it could spread from you...* - Again leading with feelings

**JB**: *Is it normal for it to make you feel sort of aroused? That kinda of felt like an weird orgasm there for a while.* - Major progress! It's physically and neurologically impossible to feel anything else than pleasure when having an orgasm, and remember this all stemed out of her past problems. I encourage that for future utilization.

**AG**: *haha yes it's normal that's your brain pleasure receptors opening up*



### Intervention #10 - Reframing past "bad" behaviors

**JB**: *Oh I see, I'm not strange then*

**AG**: *lol ... I am strange lol ... I find normal people boring as fuck (shit, did I say that out loud?? don't tell the others!)* - This is such a common issue, it's always good to make it laughable as well, especially since society and most therapists make it a "serious" topic.

**AG**: *in fact*  
*u would be surprised*  
*WHY many people come to me*  
*it's exactly BECAUSE they KNOW at their CORE there's more to experience*  
*something inside them DO NOT ACCEPT living like most people do*  
*but until you now learn HOW to*  
*it seems like you are "strange", "depressed", "sick", and all the other fancy terms society likes to label*

**JB**: *Yeah I get what your saying*  

And just like that, all her past bad emotions and pains are unconsciously understood for what they are, her body and mind signaling her something is wrong, and that something in HER is wrong.

It matters less how "true" that is, because it's a BELIEF, and useful beliefs are operationals, and think about the implications of what I just installed in her.

Any physical pain, and emotional pain, is an opportunity for her to improve her life, because the pain is WRONG, the pain is STRANGE, not her. I install this belief in most my clients (and myself) on a regular basis.

It also ripples out to another belief/generalization to be propelled forwards to "what will be better" instead of dwelling on what is/was wrong. It's a powerful unconscious future pacing.


### Intervention #11 - Intensifying good feelings and health age regression
Taking all the good feeligns and age regressing her to a time in which she does not have any pain, and no symptoms of the "fibro" or "CFS".

This induction has many layers going on at the same time, I might do a dedicated post for it.

### Intervention #12 - Future pacing getting healthier through time
**AG**: *the more you go through to the future the healthier you get*

**JB**: *Back 🙂 ahhh so good. I was running! I haven't run in about twenty years, never even liked it but the freedom of running in a light healthy body. Just wonderful. You are awesome you know! I feel healthier already.*

This is mind blowing for many to comprehend ... she is actually FEELING herself running

**JB**: *Just a powerful and light leisurely run, never done that in life or wanted to so no idea where that came from. My hair grew back. My body slimmed out and my muscles strengthened. I ended up on a beach at sunset. I didn't feel tired from the running. Also had the whole body orgasm thing again. So strange to feel like that with no physical stimulus.*



### Intervention #13 - connecting good emotions with "boring" mundane routine
She mentioned she had to do boring things (i.e. work and chores) so I thought "what the hell, let's make it fun for her"
I elicited an "in the zone" state, added all the good feelings we've been building, and had her go through the "boring" stuff she had to do in her mind.


### Intervention #14 - Building want and anticipation for her future and future sessions

**AG**: *and with that, I bid you fare well for today*  
*I'm very anxious to hear from you again and all the things you are yet to experince!* - Remember she percieved herself as anxious before, so I'm sneaking it in here as a positive thing, anxious towards how good things can get  
*one last thing, you might have CRAZY FREAKIN dreams and might actually come inside in your sleep or as you wake up so if that happens, yes, it's totally natural*

### Three days later ...

---

### Intervention #15 - Turning parents' loss into health resource + future pacing
Julliane is really something else, she actually started doing this with her mother in her dreams.

I had her use the [grief to appreciation](/tools/grief-to-appreciation/) [tool](/tools/) to further feel her mother's presence, future pace it, and same with her father.

### Intervention #16 - Enjoying social situations
Since she was demonstrating such an ability to learn quickly, I wanted her to experience a deep trance phenomena, [time distortion](/tools/recurring-time-distortion/), to open up her brain and senses even more.

She went through the [time distortion](/tools/recurring-time-distortion/) [tool](/tools/) and chose social situations the first time, and intensyfing ecstasy the second time.

**JB**:  *it was going into social situations. I have this thing like going into a party or gathering of people where I'm self conscious and stressed and wired and feeling like I don't want to be there I want to just hide (and often go to the bathroom for space). It was all quite funny really, and the previous feelings got totally distorted. On thinking of it it normal time I no longer felt stressed like I wanted to go to hide in the bathroom. So that's really good!*

She then had a spontaneous profound realization about WHY she felt so self conscious and dreaded social situations in the past.

**JB**: *I've just worked out why ...*  
*Why I feel self conscious and worried about how people see me and what they think of me ...*

**AG**: *was this like a realization you just had?*

**JB**: *Yes ... I told you I was raped. It was after a party. I reported it to the police. My friends were asked to provide statements. The statements were read back to me. I didn't realise how much I was observed and judged. Most were lovely. Others said I was flirty, huggy, too trusting... Anyways. Every since that moment, I've felt like everyone is watching me and judging me in a social situation. I guess it's why a party came up as a what I first thought about.*  
*So I guess I have to do this again for the party lol*  

^^^ Notice she PROACTIVELY takes control of this charged moment. She is not asking me what to do, she goes right at it and does the trauma relief without even asking me. That's a VERY GOOD sign. The more you can get people to ACT, the more independent they will be, the more they will be geared towards SOLVING problems and IMPROVING their life, instead of staying in their old rot.

**JB**: *I made everyone* - Notice again PROACTIVE language  
*look really silly moving backwards ...* - Silly is the key word, getting people to laugh about their "problems"*  
*Feels like it's over. It's not going to happen like that again.* - That's a much better reaction than "it will never happen again", because it might happen again, but now she knows it will not be like that, not affect her the same way as before  
*Excited to see how I feel at the next social thing I have to do* - More GOLD. She's excited towards what used to make her DREAD just a few moments ago ...  
*It means I can enjoy socialising more. Means I have made more progress to being happy and healthy again.* - Most important part, she's headed towards more happiness and health, it's just a question of how quickly she will get there now

### Intervention #17 - Enjoying social situations - future pacing
I have her connect all the great feelings AND health and hook it into future social situations

**JB**: *Everything is getting so vivid now when I'm imagining stuff*  
*It's like someone has switched my brain into. HD*

### Intervention #18 - Prepping for doctors appointment
I wanted to make sure she will take anything the doctor says in prespective of the doctor's limited knowledge and understanding. Most doctors mean well, but they often times hurt their clients unintentionaly since they are not trained in language and brain processes.  
I told her about many past mistakes doctors and scientists made about what possible or not for humans to do. She connected with it right away.

This is when she sent me the list of symptoms, and the progress since she started learning with me 3 days ago (see above)

### Intervention #19 - Compounding good feelings

I had her cycle thru good feelings from different experiences, compounding excitement, focus and energy, adding sparkels, and then while going to the future, feel herself running and jump into someone else's POV.

So she will go for a run in her mind, and see more people around running faster than her, and then jump to one of the faster runners' POV.

This is a sneaky way to expand her health feelings and push her limits, since it's easier to visualize someone else running faster than you, and by jumping to his POV, you get to feel the good feelings of running that fast.

She seemed to like it ... ;)

**JB**: *It was amazing 😛*  
*earth moved haha*  
*I had a busy day ahead though so I didn't spend as long as I'd have liked being totally immersed in it*  
*and had to peel myself up and get on. I think I'll make a date with myself tomorrow morning to revisit that 🙂*  

---

### Few days later ...

---

### Intervention #20 - Installing pre sleep routine

**AG**: *when you get into your bed cycle through past events the ones*  
*in which you feel the most vibrant alive bathed in health*  
*and do the thing you bath yourself in the good healthy feelings, and then jump to the next one*  
*... as you do so think about the good sleep your about to have and see yourself waking up in the morning 10x times more vibrant and healthy 10x times the energy*  
*... this will condition your brain and your body to cycle this FOR you on autopilot while you sleep and dream*  
*... just remember not to jump to hard from the bed you are still not 120% yet!*  
*... imagine all the good feelings you could be having during the night!*  
*... we want to squeeze every moment of your being towards buzzing vibrant colorful feelings*

Tap to wave back
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Hi Adam. My dad once said to me as a child the mind has great control over the body when I was poorly as a youngster. I'm willing to try anything. I was diagnosed with CFS back in 1995. Went away and come back a few times, but came back with a bang to stay around 7 years ago. I have fibro too and awful back problems. I'm quite disabled now and only 38!
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">Hey Julianne
</div><div class="chat-message">I would love to teach u
</div><div class="chat-message">if you are ready to put in the past what it is you do not need anymore
</div><div class="chat-message">have you read already the post about the experiment?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yes I'm ready to do that. And yes I have.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay

</div><div class="chat-message">and it was foggy?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Put the lights on, slow down and look harder I guess?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">well you can guess
</div><div class="chat-message">or
</div><div class="chat-message">u can close your eyes and go through it now in your mind
</div><div class="chat-message">and then tell me what do you do as you see the fog on the road
</div><div class="chat-message">and you are in the car
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Depends how bad the fog is. I'd wanna turn back or stop If it was awful and I couldn't see where I was going at all!
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">ok
</div><div class="chat-message">that sounds like a smart thing
</div><div class="chat-message">now
</div><div class="chat-message">just as a warm up, let's try a little something
</div><div class="chat-message">c yourself back in the car
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Ok
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">and the fog is awful
</div><div class="chat-message">and you can barely see
</div><div class="chat-message">then fast forward until the fog begins to clear
</div><div class="chat-message">slow down
</div><div class="chat-message">look harder
</div><div class="chat-message">so you could drive your vehicle to your destination
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">OK sorry had a phone call so got distracted.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">part of life my dear
</div><div class="chat-message">so tell me when you're done with the steps
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Done
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">now
</div><div class="chat-message">what happened in 1995 and before that?
</div><div class="chat-message">what big events have you had in your past that will affect you today in unwanted ways
</div><div class="chat-message">like traumas or loss of a loved one
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I was bullied, raped, excluded from friendship, labled a lier, my dad had a heart attack. Quite a bit around that time
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">gotcha
</div><div class="chat-message">now since I can't read minds, and I'm not there with you, the only I can know what's going on is what you feed me
</div><div class="chat-message">does this make sense?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yeah it does.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">wonderful
</div><div class="chat-message">now
</div><div class="chat-message">Here's how iit's going to work
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">This is not therapy, I'm not a therapist, nor do I ever wish to be.
when I was still down in the past, insomniac, in pain and depressed,
I did not find any of them to be useful,
and I've talked to hundreds of "professionals" ...

what we are about to do is all 100% open and natural for you to learn and experience,
and here's how it's going to work,
as I've been studying human behavior, organisms,

how society shapes behavior, communication,
and the greatest learning machine of all,
the human brain,

I'm going to give you some things to try, and

whatever works for you you get to keep,
whatever doesn't you file away in the

"thing's I've tried and haven't worked for me yet."
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">sounds good?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yup!
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">Great!
</div><div class="chat-message">so let's start with something simple
</div><div class="chat-message">Think about one memory that still bothers u
</div><div class="chat-message">and you will feel better now that you are about to learn to feel better about it
</div><div class="chat-message">something that happened
</div><div class="chat-message">could be physical voilence, and argument, whatever it is
</div><div class="chat-message">think of one specific thing that happened
</div><div class="chat-message">got it?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">OK well I'll start with the lier thing. That hurt more than the trauma in some ways. Craving support and help when people turned their backs and supported the person who attacked me.
</div><div class="chat-message">Remember sitting by a lake feeling desperate. Writing poems and trying to make sense of it all
</div><div class="chat-message">I feel so bad for that girl.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">that's good you have this separation
</div><div class="chat-message">it means the hard part u've already done on your own, without even realizing
</div><div class="chat-message">now
</div><div class="chat-message">let's first only focus on the attack itself okay?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Ok
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">ok now
</div><div class="chat-message">when I had an accident with my brother
</div><div class="chat-message">a few seconds before the car hit us
</div><div class="chat-message">we were just on the motorcycle and everything was okay
</div><div class="chat-message">no signs of danger
</div><div class="chat-message">then the accident happened
</div><div class="chat-message">there was some high emotions there
</div><div class="chat-message">and a few moments after we pulled over, exchanged details with the other driver, and everything was okay again
danger is gone
</div><div class="chat-message">even tho my leg was still hurting
</div><div class="chat-message">the danger of the moment itself is gone
</div><div class="chat-message">makes sense
</div><div class="chat-message">?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yeah it does
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">so for u
</div><div class="chat-message">how old were you in that past memory&gt;?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I was 15. At a party. Like you say felt no danger, was having fun. The older boy said he would walk me home. I trusted him.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">15
</div><div class="chat-message">so
</div><div class="chat-message">I want you to go over the following steps, about that memory, and then describe to me the process u've done
</div><div class="chat-message"><a href="/tools/trauma-relief/">http://www.adamgoldman.me/tools/trauma-relief/</a>
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Ok
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I'm done
</div><div class="chat-message">Blimy, that's very interesting! The colour you got was very significant
</div><div class="chat-message">I got
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">now
</div><div class="chat-message">describe to me, step by step, in your own words, what did you do
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I watched myself at the party. Certain moments flashed back. Watched her leave with the older boy, watched her walk. Saw his intent from the start which I have never seen before. Watched how it happened. Remembered the grass and how it felt on my back. It's what I focused on at the time I think because I gave up struggling and waited for it to be over. Then I was Sat in my bed room in the floor crying after I got home. That's when I reminded. We had this program here in the UK many years ago called the benny Hill show. The music and the shows so comical and quick moving. That's how I played it back. It was really strange watching such a traumatic experience to such a fun and humourous beat. And then when I focused on how I felt after I felt good from in my chest. And It felt green like fresh morning grass. Bright as a green go sign. Positive and new. Which feels good. But very strange.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">It does feel strange, doesn't it?
</div><div class="chat-message">so now
</div><div class="chat-message">as you think about that same memory again
</div><div class="chat-message">how do you feel?
</div><div class="chat-message">what's different?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yes very strange. I feel good. Its like it wasn't what it was?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">do you want me to revert you back to your old feelings?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">No way lol I like this.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">ha!
</div><div class="chat-message">isn't it interesting
</div><div class="chat-message">I wonder
</div><div class="chat-message">if you already begin to wonder
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yes it's actually pretty incredible.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">how curious you become now
</div><div class="chat-message">as you think of this moment
</div><div class="chat-message">not too far from now
</div><div class="chat-message">where you already learned how to turn more and more things
</div><div class="chat-message">that used to bother u
</div><div class="chat-message">to this new
</div><div class="chat-message">pretty incredible feeling
</div><div class="chat-message">comical even
</div><div class="chat-message">how awesome is that?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">It is very awesome. And I didn't think it would be possible.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">did you know you are going to feel so good about this just a few moments ago before we started?
</div><div class="chat-message">and you didn't think it would be possible ...
</div><div class="chat-message">I wonder what else you can begin to wonder,
as you wander around these good feelings,
about what it is that is possible for you now,
that you know what you know
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">And I've tried so many times to play it back, make sense of it. See whether I did make it happen if it was my fault. If I remember it right. To suddenly feel this way is incredible.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">describe to me this incredible feeling
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">And yes. The possibilities now seem quite wonderous
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">I think i've earned to have some of that too!
</div><div class="chat-message">the more you share the better you feel you know <img alt="😉" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z57/1/16/1f609.png"></div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Lol yes. I know. I learnt quickly around this time not to share. So it's quite a rewind!
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">now
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">It's a wonderful feeling Adam. Like you say not only a feeling though. It's like a liberation and excitement cause the possibilities of this are pretty endless! You have found something here I believe. Thank you!

Got interrupted by the door twice pfft. So took me a while to get back in the zone but I persisted. That was really good! I chose excitement.</div><div class="chat-message">It's a good motivator.

</div><div class="chat-message">So even if its not me you are thinking of, I do have it yes. I've learnt to overcome it somewhat but it's still there.

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">how do you let it creep in?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">By thinking about it
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">is it a picture in your mind of something?
</div><div class="chat-message">teach me how to make this feeling
</div><div class="chat-message">so do I need to make a picture of myself?
</div><div class="chat-message">or I say stuff to myself?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Like I'm being led by someone towards an big open disused warehouse. Dark inside, nothing there. And that person leaves saying it will be here soon. And your just waiting for it to come out of the darkness and scare you. Not knowing what or who it will be or how it will make you feel but you feel it will be something horrible. Scarey. Dangerous. Something or someone bringing negative consequences.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">gotcha
</div><div class="chat-message">run the same process you've learned on that

I couldn't get to the scarey part, it kept changing. Instead of something coming out that I didn't want to, it was good stuff. I feel kinda silly even saying it but it's like bright lights of good stuff coming out from where I expected something awful to come from. What's going on lol I sound like a right head case.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">lol

</div><div class="chat-message">(later tell me if that feeling has a shape or a size btw)
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Same things happening to most stuff. They are many wavy lines of light moving towards me from the thing/situation I'm thinking about all different colours.

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Just a powerful and light leisurely run, never done that in life or wanted to so no idea where that came from. My hair grew back. My body slimmed out and my muscles strengthened. I ended up on a beach at sunset. I didn't feel tired from the running. Also had the whole body orgasm thing again. So strange to feel like that with no physical stimulus.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">it was strange, wasn't it?
</div><div class="chat-message">nowthere's the wrongful old saying
</div><div class="chat-message">"practice makes perfect"

</div><div class="chat-message">"practice makes permanenet"

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Ok
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">and then in your mind go through everything you need to do, and feel yourself getting lighter as you get more and more done
</div><div class="chat-message">and with that, I bid you fare well for today
</div><div class="chat-message">I'm very anxious to hear from you again and all the things you are yet to experince!

</div><div class="chat-message">describe to me what u've done
</div><div class="chat-message">any feedback is immensly useful
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Being able to join my mother into memories with my friend. I remember lots of good experiences with my friend like laughter and togetherness and acceptance, support and encouragement. Where as I struggle to think of those times with my mother as they are clouded by the sense of loss that I feel. And also by the fact that when I was grown up enough to have more of a friendship with my mother - my mother was diagnosed with dementia and I lost that stage of our relationship. Back to the exercise though, the good feelings were like smoke that I breathed in. And they traveled around my body in my blood stream just like oxygen would. It wasn't powerful but it was significant and relaxing and tranquil. Whooshing round my body. And in my head I could picture my mother next to my friend in all the lovely memories I have with my friend. It was nice. And yes, when I think of mum now, I always have these good feelings with it <img alt="🙂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z4c/1/16/1f642.png"></div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">ahhhhh

Going round and round my body

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">No I tried to keep it a separate exercise but with the same friend I used for the last one with my mother.

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">new ones?
</div><div class="chat-message">with whom?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">The same friend. Like other memories I didn't think about in the last exercise.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">haha yea that tends to happen

They are different feelings. Like I said, they died before the relationship made that change from me being a child to an adult. I was a difficult adolescent when they were here and well. So that is lovely. Experiencing feelings I wouldn't have been able to find when thinking of them! So that's pretty revolutionary to me</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">Great!
</div><div class="chat-message">and can you see all 3 together?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yeah

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">well

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Each time I head into the future it's getting better and better. And I'm sort of finding a pattern to how I do it too like I imagine getting ready to run putting on the socks, trainers, leggins, and running bra, tying my hair up, putting on a band. To hold it back then stretching and closing my eyes preparing to run. Focusing back on the exercise. Seeing the people with me. Seeing them in the positive situations with me. Then breathing in the smoke, and feeling it stronger and stronger. Then startting to run. Watching my life playing out in a haze either side of me smiling at what's happening. All the good things I wanted to see pausing each taking deep breaths of the positive smoke and breathing it back out towards all the events I'm seeing and watching it infuse the future images positively.

</div><div class="chat-message">?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Very much. Before I started to learn with you I dreaded the future. Dreaded what I'd see round the corner. Anxious of what awful would happen next. Feeling no hope to get better but searching and searching in vein to find answers not wanting to give up. More because I'm stubborn and persistent rather than having hope.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">This hasn't just given me hope. Its shown me how. And I believe I can do this now.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">can do what?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Carry on, keep going. I felt like I was dying.

</div><div class="chat-message">when you finish your run
</div><div class="chat-message">u take all the good feelings
</div><div class="chat-message">DOUBLE them
</div><div class="chat-message">and teleport yourself to the earliest memory you have
</div><div class="chat-message">so you go through all your memories and past events, with the new resources
</div><div class="chat-message">as they become more and more a part of u
</div><div class="chat-message">until you reach the present moment
</div><div class="chat-message">and then you do one quick jolt into the future

</div><div class="chat-message">share!
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I forgot to say that last night I did the exercise about getting more of a good feeling/resource again. This time is was for energy. And the memory was dancing. Dancing was a massive part of my childhood. I trained to be a dancer, did very well and performed on some big stages. Till I got unwell that is <img alt="😕" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zf2/1/16/1f615.png"> had to give it up. Anyways I'm telling you cause this time I wasn't just running. I was dancing. Running and leaping through the past and stopping to dance at the various points I reached I wanted to experience and fill with smoke. And this time when I had finished my trip through the future. I danced on the beach. With my parents and my friend. And there were others, faces I've never seen that wanted to dance with me. Faces I had forgotten in the past. And I finished by stepping back from them as they carried in dancing into the night. I laid on the sand and carried on experiencing the feelings and the smoke and the intense pleasure. And I suppose now more expectedly had the whole body climax again. Haha sorry i was typing and coming back to earth <img alt="😛" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z9f/1/16/1f61b.png"></div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">that is so cool

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I havent tried yet. But I'm going to.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">don't start full power
</div><div class="chat-message">u'll have plenty of time for that
</div><div class="chat-message">the physical body is always just a bit behind your amazing mind
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">No I won't lol
</div><div class="chat-message">Yeah I as gonna say I think my body is defiantly getting better but it needs more time
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">the best way to do so
</div><div class="chat-message">is start walking faster
</div><div class="chat-message">in your sports cloth
</div><div class="chat-message">and
</div><div class="chat-message">quickly run in your mind
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yeah that's what I was thinking.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">get all the good feelings
</div><div class="chat-message">and then pick up the pace
</div><div class="chat-message">for a little bit
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Okay
</div><div class="chat-message">Sounds good.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">then run it quickly in your mind again
</div><div class="chat-message">then you pick up the pce
</div><div class="chat-message">pace*
</div><div class="chat-message">for a little bit
</div><div class="chat-message">then slow down a bit
</div><div class="chat-message">run it in the brain
</div><div class="chat-message">and so forth
</div><div class="chat-message">and each time you do
</div><div class="chat-message">u connect physical run with mind run
</div><div class="chat-message">and that's when interesting stuff will begin to happen even faster <img alt="🙂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z4c/1/16/1f642.png"></div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Oooh ok

</div><div class="chat-message">That was amazing.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Trying to remember the first thing I did now lol OK yeah so it was going into social situations. I have this thing like going into a party or gathering of people where I'm self conscious and stressed and wired and feeling like I don't want to be there I want to just hide (and often go to the bathroom for space)
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">It was all quite funny really, and the previous feelings got totally distorted.
</div><div class="chat-message">On thinking of it it normal time I no longer felt stressed like I wanted to go to hide in the bathroom. So that's really good!
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay now
</div><div class="chat-message">how do you feel about that?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I felt good like those situations will be much better for me.
</div><div class="chat-message">Then I did the ecstasy junky thing <img alt="🙈" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z52/1/16/1f648.png"></div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">haha
</div><div class="chat-message">now remember what you do with intense good feelings?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Times them by 10 lol
</div><div class="chat-message">An explode seems to be what happened lol
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">great
</div><div class="chat-message">remember to run to healtheir and healthier futures now
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I will <img alt="🙂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z4c/1/16/1f642.png"></div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">What is the time distortion exercise meant to do for a negative and a positive situation?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">lol what do you mean
</div><div class="chat-message">(did your un to the future btw?)
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I'm just trying to see if how I felt was how it was aiming to make me feel. Yeah. I ran a future positive situation after the past negative.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">well
</div><div class="chat-message">none of this is really "meant" to do anything
</div><div class="chat-message">so keep your explorer hat on <img alt="🙂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z4c/1/16/1f642.png"></div><div class="chat-message">it's mostly exploring and learning
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Hmmm I get you but what was I meant to learn? I'm just curious I guess lol
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">how to subjectively distort time of course
</div><div class="chat-message">and how it can effect your experience
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yeah I get that. Ah I dunno it's probubly a stupid question really that is the answer that sums it up and I already knew that hahahaha
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">lol the stupid question is one unasked
</div><div class="chat-message">these things that we do are really very simple and have no deeper meaning
</div><div class="chat-message">other than you learn to alter your physiology and neurology at the deepest level of your core
</div><div class="chat-message">so I'm curious
</div><div class="chat-message">what happens now as you think of a future scenario
</div><div class="chat-message">a social gathering
</div><div class="chat-message">a party
</div><div class="chat-message">fmaily dinner
</div><div class="chat-message">etc
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I don't have the same feels of dred. Feels like I'm in control of making it ok.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">how would you like to behave in those situations
</div><div class="chat-message">if you could design every bit of it
</div><div class="chat-message">more/less chatty
</div><div class="chat-message">more/less conspicuous
</div><div class="chat-message">more/less energetic
</div><div class="chat-message">same for nice, caring, patient, whatever
</div><div class="chat-message">for example
</div><div class="chat-message">which type
</div><div class="chat-message">of social situation
</div><div class="chat-message">used to trouble you the most in the past?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Less self-conscious.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">family gatherings?
</div><div class="chat-message">parties with friends?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I want to hide
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">haging out?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yeah all really. I love to. Socialise but find it hard. Initially. A while in I relax and it gets better.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">which one was the hardest in the past?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">What you mean an event?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">which type of event
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">I've just worked out why.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">wait lol
</div><div class="chat-message">jsut worked out what?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Why I feel self conscious and worried about how people see me and what they think of me.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">was this like a realization you just had?
</div><div class="chat-message">would you like to share with the rest of the class?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yes. It just popped up from my past. You know I told you I was raped. It was after a party. I reported it to the police. My friends were asked to provide statements. The statements were read back to me. I didn't realise how much I was observed and judged. Most were lovely. Others said I was flirty, huggy, too trusting... Anyways. Every since that moment, I've felt like everyone is watching me and judging me in a social situation. I guess it's why a party came up as a what I first thought about.

Said I'm not going to let my life get sucked up by this and I need help. I've been plodding along on pain killers for ages. I wanted to pick apart what's happening to me and get myself better.
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">it's the first time you will do this kind of appointment ?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Not really. I've seen specialists and the all sorts. It's more that I stopped fighting for answers for a very long time. Then I started to get worse. And I decided I need to be pushing again. And that they might not really understand. I have too many symptoms to list in a 10 min appointment. Or discuss. So I went In with  a list last week lol
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">are there still any symptoms left at this instant?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Yes. But let me show you a list of where I was last week. It will be helpful for you to see I think. Hang on I'm copying and pasting.

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">that's great news!
</div><div class="chat-message">so in the past what were your old reactions after a camp?

But that structural. I have a curved spine. You can't tell from looking at me. Have a form for an xray actually so I wonder how that is now. I think much of what I feel now is being very unfit. I've been poorly for so long. It's hot here too! Also I was canoeing yesterday which wouldn't have helped my back at all lmao
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Camping chairs. Sleeping on camp beds. Camping food. Plus I have to inject vitamin b12 for pernicious anaemia. That's got its own symptoms too.

</div><div class="chat-message">do you have a routine before you go to sleep?
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">No. Should do really. But being unwell most days I'd just work as hard as I could throughout the day. Rest a bit, work a bit, and vice versa till I hit a brick wall and stagger to bed lol
</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay
</div><div class="chat-message">I have something very useful for u

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix adam"><div class="chat-message">okay

</div></div><div class="chat-message-container clearfix other"><div class="chat-message">Oooh this sounds like a good plan
