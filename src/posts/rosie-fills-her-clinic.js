A sweet lady in her late 30’s that couldn’t seem to kick off her new acupuncture clinic off the ground.

She tried many different approaches and strategies to get clients, but “something just didn’t feel right”.

After some digging we struck gold.

She had a short movie in her mind running on repeat from her childhood, when her teacher looked her straight in the eye and uttered “you are just not good enough, might as well give it up.”

From that point change was inevitable.

We age regressed her deeper into the past, prior to that event, and installed in her an unshakable inner conviction and belief.

THEN I asked her to go through that experience again and see how it changes with her new (super?) powers.

Her entire body lightened, as she was growing up in confidence and age, relieving more and more past experiences in a new way.

When she “came back” to the present, she broke into tears, adorably thanking me over and over again :)

Today she is fully booked and wakes up excited to help people live better painless lives.
