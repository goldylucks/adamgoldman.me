![Self esteem gif](${cloudImg('adamgoldman.me/self-esteem')})

As much as I don't like those terms, they seem to find me over and over again through other people, so here goes ...

The following is a recursive process I've been using for some good years now and it's working devastatingly well for me and others.

Even tho I can help you [shorten this tremendously](/contactNEW), **I** really have the **urge** to urge **you** to **do it now** first, as you gain more control over your "self" and life.

---

#### Process
1. **Express** what it is that bothers you. i.e. "I have low confidence"

2. Have someone **ask** you "how do you know that?"
(Ask yourself if there's no one around you can do this with)

3. **Pour** everything that comes to mind, UNFILTERED

4. Have someone **ask** you "anything else?"
(Ask yourself if there's no one around you can do this with)

5. **Pour** everything that comes to mind, UNFILTERED

6. **Extract** all **BEHAVIORS** to a list

7. **State** measurable end goals

8. **Break** to ACTIONABLE steps

9. **Log** & **repeat**

---

#### Example
1. *"I have low self esteem"*

2. how do you know that?

3. *"What do you mean? I feel it all the time.  It's just "there". I practically apologize for a living. I can barely talk to people, let alone look them in the eye."*

4. Anything else?

5. *"umm .. I'm sure there's more. Like I look down and slop my shoulders when I walk, and I have this feelings others are better than me, like I'm not good enough."*

6. Now extract the behaviors:

 - Apologizing too much
 - Can barely talk to people
 - Looking away immediately when someone is looking at me
 - looking down when walking
 - slopping shoulders when walking <br />

7. Now, for each behavior, state a measurable end goal:

 - Apologizing less than 10 times a day
 - Strike a conversation with 3 strangers a day, and hold one for a minute or more
 - Hold eye lets-talk for 3 seconds, 3 times a day
 - Look up when walking for 1 minute a day
 - Pull back shoulders when walking for a minute a day  

8. Awesome.
Now break each one of those to the [tiniest](TITLE_No_such_thing_as_too_small,_too_easy,_or_too_dumb_here) ACTIONABLE steps you could think of.

 **Apologizing less than 10 times a day**

  - Track each "sorry", "excuse me", "my bad", etc

  - Log daily apologizes (Include context, data & time, i.e. *"10/06 Said sorry to stranger at Starbucks when HE dropped his fork"*)

  - After logging for a week, identify recurring [themes](TITLE_Before_speaking_at_family_dinner,_expressing_different_opinion,_etc)

  - Set reminders for those contexts and have end goal in mind

  - After logging for a week, compare between the two (if you are not surprised, coffee is on me ;))

  - Progress for another week and [share](FB_SHARE) the results

  **Strike a conversation with 3 strangers a day, and hold one for a minute or more**

 - Set reminders for times where people [roam freely](TITLE_walking_to_the_office,_launch_break,_walking_the_dog_etc)

 - Move pupils to the direction of 10 people at least, for 4 days

 - Tilt head slightly to the direction of 10 people at least, for 4 days

 - Nod slightly to 10 people at least, for 4 days

 - Smile at 10 people at least, for 4 days

 - Smile and say "hi" to 10 people at least, for 4 days

 - Smile, say "hi, let me quickly ask you something.", wait for a moment, and comment or ask something about them, their cloth, appearance, behavior, or the surroundings, with 10 people for 4 days.

 - Smile, ask something, and comment briefly on their answer, with 10 people for 4 days (*"oh you got that shirt from Bernies? Nice!"*).

 - Smile, ask, comment, and add a question or statement of your own, with 10 people, for 4 days

9. As you feel good with each step you take, your desire will grow now for more learnings that enrich your life, and if you are not careful you might end up at one of my [advanced courses](/book-me) ;)

Talk soon,

**PS.** Works from my own experience AND [people I've helped](/transcripts). Even tho [I have faster ways](/tools) to induce learnings and desire results, this is still very powerful. **Do it!**
