Yael came to see me with cluttered unquiet mind, hiding a very sad look underneath. Her mother passed away a few years prior to seeing me, and she couldn’t “let go”. 

She was constantly thinking of the loss, and all of the things she will not be able to do with her again. 
 
One hour and a [grief resolution](/tools) later, and her heart was saturated with appreciation and warmth about all the GOOD memories of the time they had together, and all the ways her future will be brighter thanks to that.

A week after she reported feeling a sense of liberation, as well as “letting go” of 5 Kg (that she wanted to lose long ago) without changing her lifestyle, habits, diet or exercise.

If you have lost a loved one(s), like many before you, go through [these steps](/tools) and turn it into appreciation and presence.
