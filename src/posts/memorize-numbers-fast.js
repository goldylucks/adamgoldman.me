394 463 2125

I've used it three days ago to memorize a number under a minute, and today I still remember it with ease.

Here's how I've done it.

1. think of a number you remember well

2. access the sequence you recall it

for me it's:
Auditory: "what's my phone number?"
Visual: I see a movie of the number being burnt on something (on what really ... will elicit more SMs later)

3. Take the new number you want to remember long term (for me it's my new local phone number)

4. repeat the recall process on new number
For me it would b:
Auditory: "What's my new local phone number?"
Visual: I see a movie of 394 463 2125 being burnt on somehting

5. break state with many different things in different contexts through different meta programs
i.e. think of people I know, different times, places, feelings

6. Fire off first step of recall
Auditory: "What's my local phone number?"

7. Note which digits I recall correctly

8. Repeat

#### To try:
- imagining different people saying the number out loud

- seeing the number in different colors and textures

- imagining different people imagining the number the same way
