## What I've learned video
I just LOVE this guy presents hard-to-digest information in such an elegant friendly way. I've watched all [his videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYPhGiB9tkShZorfgcL2lA), multiple times.

## Personal Experience
I started by skipping breakfast, hence not breaking my fast from my last meal (10'ish) until launch (2'ish). For all math wizards out there let me save you the trouble, this gives us an 8 hour feeding window.

I DREADED this the first, since ... well ... I used to eat a LOT, all freaking day. People who hang around me for a whole day would be SHOCKED how much stuff I put in and "where does it go damnit???"

The idea of NOT stuffing myself for 16 hours was, to say the least, very unappealing.

The next day I woke up, went to the closest Starbucks in Makati, and had my first coffee at 09:00. If you ever been to starbucks, you know how those devilish bastarts set the stage for your hands to involuntary reach out for some "healthy goodies":

(picture of aisle here with arrows and what not)

Hunger was high, DESIRE was high, and oddly enough, double O Goldman hands decided to behave and go only for the double long espresso.

As time went by, halfway through the coffee, I guess I forgot about my devouring craves, and only about 2 hours later, when I took a break and walked around a bit, stomach started demanding attention again.

Right ...
"Another double long espresso please!"

I can swear to god some of those crossoiants and cakes where winking my way, and again, oddly enough, my hands and I were on the same side.

This time I had a much breasier time the first hour. First sip of coffee took the hunger away, almost magically. But it did NOT last long ...

one hour later I got super hungry again, and coffee or tea would not gonna cut it this time. I need something more.

I broke the fast, early than expected.

"Another double long espresso please! and some soy milk on the side."

I was "supposed" to consume calories not before 14:00, but screw that, I had to ingest SOMETHING, but here's the thing see ...

I did not FEEL like that puny plunge of soy milk would be enough, but how trustworthy are our feelings anyway? So I experiment instead, which seem to outperform feelings and theory (almost) every time for me.

Lo and behold, 10 minutes and an enhanced double long espresso later, no hunger. 
Was a smooth sailing to 14:00.

To be continued ...
