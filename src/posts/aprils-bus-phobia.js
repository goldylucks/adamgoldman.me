Young girl in her early 20’s, kept getting fired from jobs because she was late.

AG: "Well did it ever occur to you to stop?"

HER: *“You don’t understand. Whenever I get on a bus and there are all **these people there looking at me**… it’s just too crowded … I’m overwhelmed by panic and I have to get down ...”*
 
First we identified the trigger: when she was looking at the crowd at the bus, all she could see internally were judging faces staring at her.
 
Then we [swished](/tools/visual-swish/) that image to an image of her, in the near reachable future, when this was a thing of the past.
 
The whole process **took 5 minutes**.
 
The next morning I got a message around eight thirty …
 
*“Goldman you are a genius! I’m halfway through my way to work and this bus is packed! **It’s like I forgot to panic, this is great!**”*
 
I contacted her **4 years later** (15/06/2017) to ask about it, and she totally forgot she was ever phobic.

HER: *"Oh yea I remember we've done something about buses, anywayz it's fine ever since"*

If you have a phobia or an unwanted response for something, go over [these steps](/tools/trauma-relief/), and [let me know](/lets-talk/) how was it.
