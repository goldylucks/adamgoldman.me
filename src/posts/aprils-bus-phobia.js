Young girl in her early 20’s, kept getting fired from jobs because she was late.

AG: "Well did it ever occur to you to stop?"

HER: *“You don’t understand. Whenever I get on a bus and there are all **these people there looking at me**… it’s just too crowded … I’m overwhelmed by panic and I have to get down ...”*
 
First we identified the trigger: when she was looking at the crowd at the bus, all she could see internally were judging faces staring at her.
 
Then we swished that image to an image of her, in the near reachable future, when this was a thing of the past.
 
The whole process **took 5 minutes**.
 
The next morning I got a message around eight thirty …
 
*“Goldman you are a genius! I’m halfway through my way to work and this bus is packed! **It’s like I forgot to panic, this is great!**”*
 
I contacted her **4 years later** (15/06/2017) to ask about it, and she totally forgot she was ever phobic.

HER: *"Oh yea I remember we've done something about buses, anywayz it's fine ever since"*

If you have a phobia or an unwanted response for something, go over [these steps](/tools/trauma-relief), and [let me know](/contactNEW) how was it.
