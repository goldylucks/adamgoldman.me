- *"Yea I'm a hard case"*
- *"My situation is complicated"*
- *"I know this works for other people, but my problems are something else"*
- *"you don't understand, there are many things involved"*
- *"I'm not like the others, I'm different"*
- *"I don't belong, this will not work for me"*

If you are here reading these lines, I've probably sent you here in one point of [our interaction](/lets-talk/).

Maybe we were [talking 1x1](FB_MESSAGE), or you were trying one of the [brain hacking tools](/tools/), and you uttered or thought one of the above statements.

Well ... How can I say this ...

I'm getting this so often that I've actually took the time to dedicate a whole page so you can understand just how "unique" and "different" you are.

Here's the thing ...

[We](/about/) all want to think we are a special snowflake, and that there's just something about us that's just different, and there is!

Your [life experiences](/blog/sort-out-your-past/) are yours and yours alone.

No one else on this planet has the exact same [experiences](/blog/sort-out-your-past/), genes, DNA or body like you.

So go look in the mirror, smile at that sexy figure starring lustly at you, and say to yourself "This is me, and there could be only one!"

Say it loud, say it proud, and let's move on, okay?

The STRUCTURE in which you make your problems is all that matters, and it all goes thru your senses, so you are mainly:

- Talking to yourself (what most people call "thinking")
 - "It's like I have this voice in my head telling me to ..."
 - "There's this voice telling me I'm not enough"
- Seeing pictures
 - "I can see them laughing at me!"
- Hearing sounds
 - "I just hear his voice and I flip!"
 - "Loud eating / chewing make me go crazy"
- Feeling body sensations
 - "I can still feel my back against the grass / concrete" (not uncommon for rape victims)
 - "It sends shivers down my spine"

Stop right now and think about your "biggest problem". One that seem to almost control you and your life. One that once we'll solve, your life will be infintely better.

Got it?

Now notice what's the first thing that comes to your mind AS you are thinking about this problem.

Most [OCD](/tags/ocd/) cases I've encountered make themselves compulsive by first hearing an [internal dialog](/tools/internal-dialog-scrambeler/) that goes something like:

*"You MUST wash your hands 5 times or else ... "*

And then visualizing a loved one getting killed or some other [lovely scenario](/tools/trauma-relief/).

So in order to break this pattern, all they have to do is [skew the internal dialog](/tools/internal-dialog-scrambeler), [scramble the nasty visualization](/tools/trauma-relief/), and lo and behold, ["OCD" gone](/blog/ocd-and-guilt-gone-in-one-session/).

If it sounds simple it's only because IT IS, and the more you can let go of your "higher intelect" and just start to be willing to [experiment](/blog/brain-exploration/), the faster you will get it too.

So back to you ...

HOW are you making this "big problem" of yours?

It's a weird question, but just go with me for a moment or two ok?

What do you SEE in your mind? Do you see yourself in that picture, or is it through your own eyes?

What do you HEAR in your mind? Is it your voice? Do you hear it from your left? your right? infront? inside?

Now notice where in your body you feel what is it that you feel. Is it more in your chest? your legs? Your back?

I'm gonna guess it's NOT in your knees, and also NOT in your knuckles of your fingers, but you can swear this is a "problem" and that you feel bad about it right?
If you still can't find WHERE is the feeling, keep eliminating places it's definitely NOT in, until you zoom in your suspect.

And that's the level in which we'll do most of the learning and work.

[This is NOT therapy](/blog/what-we-are-not-doing).
I ain't gonna bore you to death about what your behaviors "mean" and "why" you are so screwed up.

What we do works, and [it works FAST](/transcripts).

So when you are ready to [join the others](/transcripts) and learn to operate your brain better, [talk to me](/lets-talk) and let's do this.
