**I'm sorry**your angry. I'm sorry **for many things**your doing to yourself,
unless your ready to do them **for the last time**, in which case, come away just a little closer,

The rabbit's hole only looks frightening from the outside ...

Ahhh ...
U made it ...

**Good little slave, obey your master's commands!** :)

Like [I](/who-am-i-anyway/) said, I'm sorry you make yourself angry.
Sure [I](/who-am-i-anyway/) might have helped.

We all have.

I don't deny our part of the equation.

But most of us never liked equations anyway.

U don't even have to "do" anything, as your unconscious will do it for you by the second time you will read these lines.

U see I know the word **"slave" induces something within you, and** I'm guessing **it's not** as **positive** as puppies or kittens, is it?

![Positive grumpy cat](${cloudImg('adamgoldman.me/grumpy-positive')})

*Who the fuck is this [Adam](/) dude calling me a slave?*

Exactly.

**I'm just another floating head** in the internet, and the more you allow any of us to dictate your feelings, the thicker the prison you trap yourself in becomes, and the shackles we don't see have the strongest grip on us,

So **I invite you to try the following** ...

*When someone calls me a slave, I make myself angry*

Try reading the above line and NOT feeling bad.

Try saying it out loud, or even mentally, WITHOUT an emotional response.

**Now let's talk about your purple tail**.

![Whatchu talkin' bout Adam?](${cloudImg('adamgoldman.me/purple-tail')})

Let me guess ...

Less emotional response for the purple tail?

I'm shocked ;)

That does not resonate with you on any level, **u don't identify with it, and there's no reason to feel bad**.

Of course when someone calls you a slave, an idiot, a moron, THEN feeling bad is very reasonable hah?

C it's one thing to "cure" ourselves from anger, but **set the direction to a future in which YOU control your feelings**, emotions, and behaviors ...

Now THAT'S where it's at.
That's the game changer.

As you set the direction, your unconscious now can begin to make some changes, and every time you rewire ...

*"he makes me feel ... when he ..."*  
to
"When he ... I make MYSELF feel ..."

... you get one step closer to the next operating system upgrade.

**I'm sorry** I made U angry **for the last time** ;)  
Goodbye, slave.

  ps: `

**PS**. Which other words would you like to have less of an emotional response to?
(*ahhm ahm comment below ahhm*)

**PSS**. If you want to [free yourself](/lets-talk/) from the tyranny of words faster, you know where to [find me](/lets-talk/) ;)
