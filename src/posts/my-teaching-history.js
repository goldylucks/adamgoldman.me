  That little birdie right there is **the magnificent Phoenix**, a create famous for being reborn from the ashes of it's predecessor, dating way back to Greek mythology.
   
  **I used to LOVE Greek mythology** when I was a kid.
   
  Yes, I was (am?) a geek, I admit it … But it’s not all bad, as it got me up and running with English when I was < 6 years old!

  Some odd 20+ years ago, **my brother brought home this Indiana Jones computer game and boy oh boy did I wanted to play that**!

  As I sat across Indie as he uttered his first sentence on the screen (no sound these days folks ...), **I began translating one word after another** using the family’s Hebrew/English dictionary.

  I already knew to read and write Hebrew (as any good 6 years old geek would I guess ...), so Indie became my good friend and English teacher real quick.

  I sat hours upon hours, day in day out, as Indie patiently waited (and waited …) for me to keep up with his crazy adventures.

  Maybe **that’s the** main **reason I get so amused** by folks asking me how do I **keep my students motivated**, especially the you ngest ones.

  It’s like ...  
  ARE  YOU KIDDING ME?
   
  The right question is how to stop crushing our little ones extravagant curiosity!

  **When I** finally (and sadly) **started school**, I already knew how to read and write Hebrew, English, and do basic math (nerd status update: super geek).

  **Knowing most of what was “taught”, I mainly helped other kids, mostly covertly** (Miss Rosie did NOT like me, a 6 years old kiddo with an attitude, out-teaching her in her own class).
   
  “That’s WRONG!”
   
  “It’s not what I taught you!”
   
  ... were typical responses Rosie would spit out whenever a student’s answer didn’t match hers.
   
  **Socrates main lesson was to question EVERYTHING**, even (or, **especially**) **the teachers** themselves.
   
  Is spelling “kar” really WRONG?
  It looks ⅔ correct to me!
   
  That’s how I keep my students motivated.
   
  **Focus** on what they are doing well, and **hint** about the improvement they can do, **while keeping yourself ecstatic about their progress**.
   
  **Unlike the phoenix, motivation and curiosity WILL die** out when the flame is extinguished one too many times, that’s why setting the context upfront is so important.
   
  Even the most captivating drawing of them all would appear ugly in the wrong frame.
   
  I’ll show you some good framing (and reframing) examples next time we meet.

  Keep sneaking in magic whenever you pass on knowledge. We might not have our own phoenix, but we can still give Dumbledore a run for his money ;)
