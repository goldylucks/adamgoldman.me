I'm very intuitive you see, I have male intuition. Apparently it’s supposed to be a women thing, but I learned that too late, so what the heck, I get to have it anyway. And the infinite wisdom of the universe tells me that **after your last meeting, you did NOT got much done for the rest of the day**.
 
Meetings are a special kind of **energy sucking vampires** that fear no garlic.
Avoid them like the plague!

I'm involved in many different things with different types of people and social structures, and **I RARELY attend meetings, and neither should you**.

This matrix-like-bullet-dodging skill is one of the most beneficial skills I've nurtured, and **here's the gist of it**:

Matt emails you to set a meeting next week, with you or your team, and you could reply with:
 
"I'm sorry Matt,  
As much as I would love to attend this meeting with you, and I do treasure the time we spend together, I no longer do meetings as I find them counter-productive, so fuck off and leave me the hell alone."
 
Then come apply to work for me as I'm hiring ;)
 
Okay this time for real, here we go:
 
*"Sure, it's an important thing to work on.  
Please **send me the bullet points you want to cover** so I could prepare accordingly"*

After you get the points, spend some time crafting an outstanding-Pulitzer-award-winning-prize response to each one of those bullets AND possible replies you anticipate from Matt.

This step is crucial.
Don't half ass this!

U need to **put your heart and soul into each one of those points**. I used to send them to friends, co workers, and family for ideas and improvements.

Then you**reply Matt** with your answer as *"notes for the XYZ meeting."*
 
If u've done a good job, most of the points would be resolved, and the meeting will never take place.
 
So fuck off Matt, we got some real work to do!

**Even if he still persists with the meeting, it will be extremely short**. He'll show up, read the points out loud, blurb briefly about some of them, and disperse the crowd.

Some Matt's are slower than others so yours **might take a few alterations of the above until he'll finally leave you alone**.

Face to face communication is usually best for syncing up emotionally and energetically, NOT passing knowledge back and forth.
 
**Some meetings DO need to happen**, and to maximize results **this is a process you wanna do ANYWAY**, together with defining clearly measurable outcomes, setting end time in stone, and assigning actionable items at the end to the hand-picked attendees.
 
But what if ...
 
**What if we could eliminate some of Matt emails from the get go**?

Oh yes ... 
 
**A world without emails from “above” ...** Let's take a moment to play that fantasy deep inside ...
 
*"Hey Joe,
give me a quick rundown on the new admin interface, where do we stand on everything?*

*I want to play with the header, is it done yet?  
Debby is in charge of that yes?*

*Or is it Jay?"*

*“oh sure Matt, I'm so glad you asked, I have too much free time on my hands anyway I would just LOVE to put my 17 tasks on hold while our app is up in flames, just to satisfy this oh so important sudden peak of curiosity of yours!”*
 
As annoying as Matt can be, he IS the boss (for now...), so how about we **set up an easy "system" for him to access EVERYTHING** he needs or wants to know, 24/7, and leave us the hell alone so we could all move on with our sad miserable lives?

[Let me know](/lets-talk/) when your ready streamline the communication in your company and get Matt and his friends off your back.

Yours in efficiency,

**P.S.** Ever wondered how small startups with 2 developers outperform the big dogs (Microsoft Apple Google etc)?

U'd be surprised how small tweaks into your workflow can exponentially increase productivity. It's the small difference that makes the big difference.

Much easier than the other way around ;)
