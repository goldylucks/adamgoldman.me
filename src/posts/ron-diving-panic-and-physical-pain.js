A nice little fellow at his early 30’s who’ve been through some wacky episodes in his life, which lead him to make two big ass tattoos across his chest he later regret.

Initially he wanted to complete his diving license course, which he kept failing at a specific exercise.
 
Every time he was asked to take off the mask underwater, he panicked and asked to go up to the surface.
 
A few minutes and one visual swish later, the problem was gone.

He’s now a happy certified diver.

His other problem was a bit trickier ...
 
He was in severe pain from the laser intense removal sessions, and had 6 more completely eradicate the unwanted ink from his skin.
 
He kept putting the sessions off due to the pain.
 
We did many “little tricks”, mainly played with sub-modalities and “locked” the pain behind many internal mental corridors.
(it's hard to explain, I'm working on a post on that, feel free to [message me](/contactNEW) in the meantime)
 
He went back to continue with the laser sessions, reporting the pain decreased immensely and does not bother him too much, despite being still very much "there".
 
*“It’s kinda weird because I know it hurts as before, logically, and I feel it, just in a different way. It’s totally bearable now. I still regret ever having those tattoos of course ...”*

I find the best way to avoid regretting mistakes is not to make them, as a wise super hero once taught me ...
