You know that money you got in your bank?
Well that money is not really yours.

It's *theirs*.

and the supply of that money is regulated by business man with fat paychecks that do not care much for you and me, the "little people."

One of the ways we can reclaim ownership is to use cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, or BTC.

U might be here because you want to [give back](/i-dont-charge-i-accept/), or you want to get your hands wet in the currency of the future.

Whatever it is, here's how you get going:

1. Open an account and get your wallet at [bitcoin.info](https://blockchain.info) (I use them too)
2. [Buy some bitcoin fractions](https://www.Coinmama.com/?ref=goldy). I worked with these guys and actually developed some of their technology :)
3. Stack up your good karma and honor me by being a part of your first transaction and send some of 'em coins to **14VGM3druyectkEZrZBvEjrowdbtXkurW9**
4. Drive by a big bank and give them the finger!

Change doesn't have to be painful.  
It starts with little steps.  
Tiny actions by simple folks like us two and others.  

Yours in rebellion,
