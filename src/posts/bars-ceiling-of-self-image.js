This brilliant 26 years old guy managed to generate a small fortune from youtube at it's early stages, by doing some "not too ethical" things.

After quitting that unholy practice, he had no motivation to do pretty much anything and went into a passive survival mode, literally staring at the ceiling for 16 hours a day.

If you ever wished you had more time at a day, be glad your not at the other end of the spectrum like Bar here.

If memory serves, he [contacted](lets-talk/) online and queried if [I](/about) could help him get some life into his life.

I went through similar episodes back in the day, so invited him to my apartment in Tel Aviv to see what we could do.

I also wanted to try the reverse spin I've just learned, which got some pretty intense results.

Fast forward a couple of days and few hours later, the ceiling starring marathon was over.

It took one session, using some drilling Qs and some of 'em spins, and Bar got some of his life back.

We then proceeded to make swish some nasty images that were still lurking in dark corners of his internal world (we all know how much we love those ...).

Few days after that he came to borrow some books as he (finally) finished the one he was "reading" for the past couple of years.

He also started working again, meeting some friends, go on walks and the beach, or what we might call "being alive" again :)

After a few month we did another quick session about his self image.

He was seeing himself in black & white (“it’s like a horror movie!”) from the outside. We mapped it across. Lo and behold the dude loves himself now :)

We're still in touch to this day, he's actually a very interesting piece of human being, I learn a lot from him and we constantly bounce ideas off each other.

He was so blown away from his fast change he started learning NLP as well and now helps others on a regular basis.

If you are in Israel, I highly recommend paying him a visit. He gets insane results and if you buy him dinner he got some pretty intriguing stories to tell.
