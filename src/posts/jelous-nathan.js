29 years old who got jealous whenever his girlfriend went out without him.

He had pictures of her in his mind flirting with others.

I asked him if this happen ALL the time, and how does he know when to stop being jealous (funky question eh?).
 
*“when I C her again afterwards and she gives me this look and I just KNOW she’s mine”*
 
I asked him to make the worst jealousy pictures he can imagine for the last time (sneaky presupposition), and next to that see Eden giving him “this look”.
 
Jealousy was gone INSTANTLY.

the whole process took just a few minutes.
