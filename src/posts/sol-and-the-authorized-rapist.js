A very religious student, came to see me at her 20’s. First time she was raped was at age 16. Not once, not twice, but a few times a week (sometimes a day!) for almost a year, by an authority figure in her community, which she did not want to disclose or press charges against.
 
She didn’t have a specific “thing” she wanted to do or work on. She just said her life is a mess, and her mind is cluttered all the time.
 
First thing we’ve done was to [clean the trauma](/tools/trauma-relief) and re-encode all those experiences in a less tense way.
 
Then we connected the experience to feelings of hope, possibility, and self confidence (*“now that u’ve got over that, there’s no telling what you could do!“*).
 
Lastly, we tied it up with [beliefs](/tools/internal-dialog-scrambler) and behaviors of self worth, so people would stop walking all over her, which apparently happened constantly in her life.
 
In total we’ve done 5-6 sessions, which resulted in …
 
Grades average -> up by 20 points
Weight -> down by 6 Kgs
 
But most importantly, as she says …
