I'm not sure if and where you can get this training anymore, this is more of a note for myself, feel free to [ask me](/contactNEW) anything regarding :)

Some time you drive and suddenly you get alerted, and there's someone driving in the next lane at the same speed. and you need to get out in the next intersection so you speed up to bypass him, and he speeds up. you slow down and he slows down.

- tape 2 - 08:00 - Patient with voices from a wall plug. Bandler put a speaker in the wall and said "r you listening? this messages are not for you. stop eavesdropping!"
- tape 2 - 08:30 - Patient said the CIA is after him. Bandler and John came to his house with suits and sunglasses and said "we are from the agency. come with us please". Patient immediately said "oh no I'm a schyzo! I'm not REALLY wanted by the CIA!"
make the psychosis real, and it's gone! Or spoil it :)
- tape 2 - 10:00 - Dutch catholic woman had "voices" which she claimed coming from other people, weren't hers, telling mean things about her husband. Bandler changed her voices to dutch, meaning it MUST be hers cuz people around her did not speak dutch (this was in the USA)
- tape 2 - 42:14 - Parrot induction!
- tape 3 - 25:00 - watching memory backwards: if you run a war movie backwards, it becomes a movie of peace! the planes fly backwards, suck all the flames and destruction, package it into the bombs, go back to base, unload, ship the bombs to the factory to be dismantled, and soldiers go back to their families being treated with love
- tape 4 - 27:00 - boredom is a lot worse than taking unnecessary risks. Any of you who have teenagers. Any of you who WERE teenagers can verify this as well.
- tape 4 - 29:55 - mutual greed
- tape 4 - 33:00 - how submodalities affect one another
- tape 4 - 37:00 - congruent elicitation
- tape 4 - 49:00 - the unhappy gene (LOL)
- tape 4 - 01:00:00 - reframing mistakes + add good feelings
- tape 4 - 01:18:00 - hysterical laughter induction + anchoring entire crowd (this is awesome, John is actually charismatic here!)
- tape 4 - 01:30:00 - demo: laughing through a trauma
