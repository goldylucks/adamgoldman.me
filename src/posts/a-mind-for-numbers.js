7/10 people I meet claim to be bad learners, especially in the field of math and science. If you are one of those 7, [this book will help you tremendously](http://amzn.to/2vDVzk1).

good for beginners in the field of how to learn, especially for math and science. Got some nice illustrations.

## Concepts learned:  

- chunking
- context
- spaced repetition, 
- recall vs rereading
- right brain / left brain thinking or focused/diffused thinking
- physical activity to induce recall / solve problems
- why focusing too much doesn't work (or, don't bang your head against the wall, dah ...)
- Interleaving - practice by doing a mixture different kinds of problems requiring different strategies.

## Misc Points
- You want your brain to become used to the idea that just knowing how to use a particular problem-solving technique isn’t enough—you also need to know when to use it

- Mastering how to drive will not get you very far in the open sea, even with the best car in the world with a tank full of gas.

- Mix types of problems. Solving 100 addition questions and then 100 multiplication, is not as effective is alternating every 5.

- Teaching others what u've learned greatly solidifies learning.

- Recall information in different physical positions while moving to solidify learning.

- Rehearse in your mind while walking to the bus, being bored, etc

- students who have blindly followed their passion, without rational analysis of whether their choice of career truly was wise, have been more unhappy with their job choices than those who coupled passion with rationality.

- Use metaphors. It’s often helpful to pretend you are the concept you are trying to understand. Put yourself in an electron’s warm and fuzzy slippers as it burrows through a slab of copper, or sneak inside the x of an algebraic equation, or a graph equation

- Remember people’s names by retrieving the people’s names from memory at increasing time intervals after first learning the name

- Memory palace - Mentally walk in a place you know and place things you want to remember along the way, i.e. a giant egg open you the door, gets crushed by a pack of sugar, then in the corridor there's a pack of cigarettes (which you might wanna quit but don't know how to yet?)

- Using sentences to memorize: King Henry Died While Drinking Chocolate Milk. This translates to kilo —1,000; Hecto—100; Deca—10; “while” represents 1; Deci—0.1; Centi—0.01; Milli—0.001

- Acronyms to memorize - Let’s say you wanted to remember four plants that help ward off vampires—garlic, rose, hawthorn, and mustard. The first letters abbreviate to GRHM, so all you need to do is remember the image of a GRAHAM cracker.

- Combine memory palace with sentences: Let’s say you are trying to remember the mineral hardness scale, which ranges from 1 to 10 (talc 1, gypsum 2, calcite 3, fluorite 4, apatite 5, orthoclase 6, quartz 7, topaz 8, corundum 9, diamond 10). You can come up with a memory sentence mnemonic: Terrible Giants Can Find Alligators or Quaint Trolls Conveniently Digestible. The problem is that it can still be difficult to remember the sentence. But things become easier if you then add the memory palace. At your front door, there is a terrible giant there, holding a can. Once inside, you find an alligator

- If you’re memorizing something commonly used, see whether someone’s come up with a particularly memorable memory trick by searching it out online. Otherwise, try coming up with your own (and open source it)!

- Persistence is often more important than intelligence.

- Approaching material with a goal of learning it on your own gives you a unique path to mastery.

- Ask questions to LEARN, not to show how much you know (like most people do)

- A simple sentence growing from the vast experience of a mentor can change the course of your future

- Truly great teachers make the material seem both simple and profound, set up mechanisms for students to learn from each other, and inspire students to learn on their own

- Learning and brainstorming with like minded people is easier, but if your all TOO like minded about too many things, you won't uncover each others' blind spots.

- "You need to think about what the equation means, so that your math result and your intuition match. If they don’t match, then you have either a mistake in your math or a mistake in your intuition. Either way, you win by figuring out why the two don’t match"

- Explore the end of the model for better understanding. For a complicated expression, take limiting cases where one variable or another goes to zero or infinity, and see if that helps you understand what the equation is saying

- Testing is itself an extraordinarily powerful learning experience

- outline lots of problem solutions quickly, without spending time on the algebra and calculations, so you practice big picture thinking

- If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself - **Albert Einstein**

## Taking tests
- Scan entire test, start with hardest question, pull away to an easy question the moment you get stuck. This will get your difuse mode thinking working on the hard task in the background, as you work yoru way through the easy questions. I've never thought about that personally, it sounds like a nifty little tricks indeed! This can be applied to any task, at the office or in our personal lives.
- Panic and anxiety - Move THROUGH the sensations instead of fighting them, and turn your attention inwards, to your breathing and your body. Acknowledge what's going on PHYSICALLY, i.e. "my palms are sweaty, my heart is beating a bit faster". That's better than "OMG what's happening to my body", which is generating a fear OF the fear, and then your screwed ;)
- Study in the same place or at least a similar environment as the place you will take the test.
- Bonus: [Talk to me](/contactNEW), I have some mind tricks up my sleeve :)
- Doube check your answers in random order, not sequentially front to back, so you "catch you brain" ungaurd and process the information differently.
- Write any negative thought immediately before the test.

## Procrastination Zombies
- The dread of doing a task often consumes more time and energy than the task itself
- Zombies cannot be vanquished by will power
- Habit cycle: Cue -> Routine -> Reward -> Belief
- ways of breaking the habit:
  1. Develop different cues (learn for the exam in a different place, different time, with different people)
  2. Set time limit (study for 10 minutes, instead of until you finish problems a be see., this was you can't fail see :)
  3. contrast mental images. Make one vivid image of what will happen if you do the task (get a better job, promotion, etc), and one iamge if you don't (get fired, begging for money)
  4. Pomodoro technique and protecting yourself from peeps in an elegant 

## Tricks for anti procrastination:
 1. Wear sport cloth, prime yourself for workout
 2. Get up easily by mentally crave your breakfast, instead of "having" to get up
 3. Identify the easiest part to start with
 4. ^^^ Organise material needed (for math problem, copy needed equations etc ...)
 5. silence phone and laptop notifications
 6. log activities for a few weeks and notice your procrastination triggers
 7. write tomorrow's to do list prior bed time.
 8. Do the most important and most disliked jobs first, as soon as you wake up, when you are highest in energy (could be after a coffee or two ;)
 9. Infuse physical tasks (laundry, weeding, dishes) between mental ones
 10. Break long period goals to daily processes
 11. Put visual reminders of your end goal (look at the salary of an engineer while learning for the exam)
 12. Paralyzed? Jot down 3 micro-tasks you can do in minutes
 13. reward small chunks of progress (i.e. 5 minutes of YouTube after 1 pomodoro)
