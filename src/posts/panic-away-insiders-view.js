> *"You have a temporary behavioral problem, NOT a mental illness"* - **Barry McDonagh**

Even tho the first one caught him way off guard (in a very social setting), it's **been years now since his last panic attack**, and despite of what "professionals" told him, he did not "manage" or "cope" with the fear, but rather desired to [eliminate it from the source](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=from-source), and you will soon **discover he is no different than you and I**, as you watch him on TV (below).

Does Barry strikes you as a very special, confident, smart being? 

He seems like a simple man to me, but that does not stop him from [helping thousands](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=helping-thousands) in person, and tens of thousands through different means in [a very interesting way](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=interesting-way)...

He [shares some gold nuggets](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=gold-nuggets) (as you might enjoy by now) you might want to go over before you [join](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=go-over-before-you-join) more former "sufferers" before you, as you get a good feel of what you are about to receive, along with the audio recordings that will [guide you to a calmer place](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=guide-to-calmer-place) whenever you wish to [gain some peace of mind](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=peace-of-mind).

> *"when you resist the fear, it persists. It's when you move through it and observe it in a particular way, it moves and transforms"* - **Barry McDonagh**

This is the opposite of what therapists told him (and me), and he went the opposite way to [explore](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=opposite-explore) on his own what it is he did not know yet (there's a lesson in here btw).

## The most important thing
Whether you [join Barry](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=important-join-barry) and the [others](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=important-others) first, or go on an unknown path, is of less importance than the fact that something inside you wants you to experience something different.

Too many people give up, and I'm very glad you are not one of them. You deserve more from life, and life deserves more from you. The world needs you at your best.

It's not only about you, but make it start with you. You've been carrying too much for too long. Don't be another statistic. Be the best you you can be. If [me and Barry](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=me-and-barry) and countless others can learn to [feel good](http://ead105p3zfv8jv0ooem2hmqwb2.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=learn-feel-good) about past limitations, you can as well.

Your's in former anxiety,
