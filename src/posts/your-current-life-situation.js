After you [sort out your past](/blog/sort-out-your-past/), describe your current situation, without getting into specifics.

For me the "story of my life" until some years ago was:

1. Feeling lonely most of the time, even when laughing with friends and family it's still pretty much empty.
2. hate my body, no matter how much compliments I get I think I'm ugly and unattractive, and would never be.
3. jealous of my big brother. Everything comes so easy to him, as I suffer my pathetic existence
4. Future freaks me out. I have no motivation to do anything, but I'm afraid to miss out on life and the polarity drives me nuts.
5. I feel like I'm a burden on my family, which try to help but keep making things worse, and it makes me feel like I'm MORE of a burden. Fuckign vicious cycle.
6. I can barely sleep. Once every couple of days I might get away with more than 2-3 straight hours
7. My stomach hurts. A LOT. throughout the day AND when I'm in the bathroom (which is quite often, and each episode is long)
8. I feel I don't belong to my family, or anywhere else for that matter. I don't relate to friends in school,
and through most social gathering I just sit and hope no one would bother me.
9. I hate my life, but at the same time I KNOW life could be great. It would be such a waste to end it all. I just know there is a solution, and I'm actively looking for one.

(I've tried acupuncture, meditation, psychology, different kinds of "experts" and "professionals", exercise, martial arts, reading books, nothing helped yet)

To me, when I've done this way back some 10 years ago, it really helped me think clearer.

Life was still shit, but it was a bit more organised shit, you know?

Remember we are still in GATHERING INFORMATION phase.

If you catch your [internal dialog](/tools/internal-dialog-scrambeler/) going "I don't understand how this will make me feel better", that's your brain tricking you the stay in what's familiar, instead of [experiencing](/blind-cheryl-learns-about-colors/) something new and wonderful first, and THEN understand.

While it does provide a new perspective for many people I've shown this to, the main point of this is to gather and sort information so we will know where to intervene next to induce a stronger change.

Now that you are ready, [talk to me](${MESSENGER_LINK_WELCOME}) and let's begin
