Rachel is one of my favorites … Such a sweet single mother in her 50’s, living in a tiny apartment in Jerusalem. She’s been to therapy for 16 years, and paid tens of thousands of shekels (Israeli currency) to different psychiatrists, "professionals" and "experts", and things were only getting worse ...

**Rachel**: *"I know I have passions. I know there are things I want to do. But … I’ve kinda given up on it all. Yes I can wake up in the morning, do my little routine, go to work, come back, and call it a day, but …*

*Is that it?  
That’s all life got to offer?"*

A few minutes into the conversation a severe [trauma](/tools/trauma-relief/) from her childhood had surfaced.

When she was 6 years old, her father made her face the closet and search for a pen, while he yelled (and slightly beat her up) for 12 straight hours, all along being cheered by her mother, because *"HOW DARE YOU LOSE THE PEN I GAVE U AS A GIFT?!?!"*

**Rachel**: *"It was just too much, I'll ever forget the look on my father's face, he did not want to do it, but my mom was cheering so hard ... I couldn't handle all of that ... and for a god damn pen???"*

so I asked her,

**Adam**: *"if I paint a horrible picture on your biggest wall in your house, would you leave it there?"*

**Rachel**: *"Of course not! I will redecorate, I wouldn't want to look at that so often"*

**Adam**: but you live it in your mind ...  
how often do you see this wall in your house?
how often do have this mind with you?
Does this strike you as useful behavior?

**Rachel**: *"well no but HOW do I redecorate my mind?"*

We ran [some processes](/tools/trauma-relief/) to re-encode the experience, and at a certain point she began smiling with tears flowing down her cheek.

Instead of being immersed in the experience and relieving it from her 6 years old self point of view, she was now sitting in a theater, with her parents, watching the entire act with goofy music, as if it was a parody about her life.

Talk about creativity!

I’ve done hundreds of [sessions](/transcripts/) with people, and witnessed hundreds more done by others, and this is one of the most wackiest original crazy over the top transformations I’ve ever seen.

About a month later, Rachel reported waking up with a smile again, going for walks outside, started writing again (turns out she published a book in the past!), and was seeing someone new!

We've done more progress in one session than 16 years combined of "therapy".

(Refund anyone?)

If you wish to turn some of your traumas into resources, and get things going in your life, you know where to [find me now](/lets-talk/).

Dare to aim yourself towards a great life,`,
  ps: `
Remember to [calibrate](/blog/calibrate-intervene-calibrate/) first. If you still have some past traumas, I encourage you to [go through the process](/tools/trauma-relief/) Rachel has, and do it with the curiosity about what it is you will learn about your brain. Do NOT expect it to have a certain outcome, because you have to experience it first.
