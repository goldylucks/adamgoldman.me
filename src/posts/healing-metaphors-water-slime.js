# Intro

Date of session: OCT 31th, 2017  
Client's Name: Tamar Herbert  
Age: ??  
Diagnosis: Fibromyalgia, C.F.S., M.E.  
Medium of communication: Facebook chat  

I've been working with Tamar for some time now, and we already cleared many traumas, nightmares, anxiety, PTSDs and many negative feelings (full case study up ahead - brace yourself)

This particular session was solely on her feelings from this morning, following a really intense disturbing vivid dream she woke up from.

If you are not familiar with clean language and working with metaphors, this will seem pretty freakin' WHACKY to you. 

Proceed ONLY with an open mind about what your mind is capable of.  

Special thanks to the late David Grov for giving life to this field.

# Notes from the session

<br />

## Metaphor #1 - rugby ball - eliciation
[and when you have a ton of weight](adam)
[I'm rocking baby down, I'm not gonna fall off the chair right?! <img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png" />](other)

[when you feel the weight?](adam)
[In my ribcage like it's constricted](other)
[and in ribcage](adam)
[and it's constricted](adam)
[and when it's in ribcage](adam)
[and is it on the outside or on the inside](adam)
[Inside](other)
[when you have a ton of weight](adam)
[and in ribcage](adam)
[and in the inside](adam)
[and when it's in the inside](adam)
[and in ribcage](adam)
[does it have a shape or a size?](adam)
[when it's in ribcage](adam)
[and a ton of weight](adam)
[and in the inside?](adam)
[Oval <img alt="🙂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z4c/1/16/1f642.png" />](other)
[and Oval](adam)
[and is there anything special about an Oval](adam)
[when in ribcage](adam)
[and on the inside](adam)
[?](adam)
[Not specifically but it's not moving its like it's wedged and stuck](other)
[and an Oval like what?](adam)
[and it's not moving](adam)
[A rugby ball](other)

## Metaphor #1 - rugby ball - empowering & maturation
[and wedged and stuck](adam)
[and a rugby ball](adam)
[and is there anything else about rugby ball](adam)
[when it's wedged and stuck](adam)
[?](adam)
[It's stopping me breathing v well](other)
[and it's stopping breathing](adam)
[and can it's stop you breathing v well?](adam)
[Yes](other)
[and yes](adam)
[and after it stopping breathing v well](adam)
[and what does rugby ball wants to do next?](adam)
[Nothing. It won't budge](other)
[and it won't budge](adam)
[and after it won't budge](adam)
[and rugby ball in ribcage](adam)
[then what happens?](adam)
ther than the sick feeling not much

## Metaphors #2 - courgette - eliciation
She mentions a feeling ("sick"), time to fish for the next metaphor!

[Other than the sick feeling not much](other)
[and sick feeling](adam)
[and when you have sick feeling](adam)
[and whereabouts is the sick feeling](adam)
[when you have sick feeling?](adam)
[My stomach](other)
[and in stomach](adam)
[And my throat](other)
[and in throat](adam)

Separate the two locations

[and when it's in stomach](adam)
[and thorat](adam)
[and whereabouts in stomach](adam)
[and in throat?](adam)
[when it's a sick feeling?](adam)
[Top of the stomach. All of the throat](other)
[and top of the stomach](adam)
[and all of the throat](adam)
[and when it's in top of stomach](adam)
[and all of the throat](adam)
[where do you feel it more](adam)
[and it's a sick feeling](adam)
[and in top of the stomach](adam)
[and all of the throat?](adam)
[Throat I think actually.](other)
[and throat](adam)
[and when it's in throat](adam)
[does it have a shape or a size](adam)
[when it's in throat?](adam)

[Size large <img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"> it feels like a thick short courgette <img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"><img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"><img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"><img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"><img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"><img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"><img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png" />](other)

## Metaphors #2 - courgette - maturation

[and Large](adam)
[and like a thick](adam)
[short](adam)
[courgette](adam)
[and when it's large](adam)
[and a thick](adam)
[short](adam)
[courgette](adam)
[and what does a courgette like to have happen?](adam)
[It expands and contracts](other)
[and it expands and contracts](adam)
[and expands and contracts like what?](adam)
[and is there anything else](adam)
[when it expands and contracts?](adam)
[<img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"> I think u may have a career in helping writers](other)
[It feels slimy](other)
[and slimy](adam)
[and slimy like what?](adam)

## Metaphors #2 - maturation - courgette -> slug
[A slug](other)
[and a slug](adam)
[and is there anything special about a slug](adam)
[that's in throat](adam)
[?](adam)
[It's throbbing](other)
[and throbbing](adam)
[and after it's throbbing](adam)
[and what happens next?](adam)
[after it's throbbing](adam)
[Nothing. The slug is stuck too!](other)
[and slug is stuck too](adam)

So at this point rugby ball is in ribcage, slug has matured from courgette, and there's the unexplored sick feeling in stomach, which we'll elicit a metaphor from next ...

## Metaphor #3 - elicitation - toxic dirty water

[and when it's sick in stomach](adam)
[and on top of stomach](adam)
[does it have a shape or a size](adam)
[when it's in top of stomach?](adam)
[It's like a swirling sea.... Thing. I can't think of the word I want](other)
[and swirling sea ... Thing](adam)
[and when it's like a swirling sea ... Thing](adam)
[and is there anything else, when it's like a swirling sea ... Thing
?](adam)
[It feels unhappy like really toxic dirty water](other)

## Metaphor #3 - empowering & maturation - toxic dirty water

[and toxic water](adam)
[and what would toxic](adam)
[dirty water](adam)
[like to do next](adam)
[when it's in top of stomach](adam)
[and it's like really](adam)
[toxic](adam)
[dirty water?](adam)
[Bubble and gurgle](other)
[and bubble and gurgle!](adam)
[and can it bubble and gurgle?](adam)
[Yes](other)
[and Yes!](adam)
[and it can bubble and gurgle ...](adam)
[and bubble and gurgle ...](adam)
[and take all the time it needs](adam)
[to bubble and gurgle](adam)
[and after toxic, dirty water, bubble and gurgle](adam)
[and what would toxic, dirty water like to do next?](adam)
[I don't think it wants to do anything it's pretty stagnant](other)
[and stagnat](adam)

## Metaphors - rallying up the troops
At this point we have 3 metaphors:
 - Rugby ball - ribcage - haven't matured at all
 - Slug - throat - Evolved (courgette -> slug) and matured (throbbing -> stagnat)
 - Toxic water - top of stomach - matured (bubble and gurgle -> stagnat)

First I'm pointing her awareness to all of them ...

[and rugby ball in ribcage](adam)
[and slimy slug in throat](adam)
[and toxic dirty water in stomach](adam)

... Then mature the entire experience:

[and what happens next](adam)
[and after slug thrubbing](adam)
[and toxic water Bubble and gurgle](adam)
[and then what happens?](adam)

## Metaphor Integration Starts
[They sort of all merge into one <img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png" />](other)

[and they all merge into one!](adam)
[and merge into one!](adam)
[and as they merge into one](adam)
[and take all the time they need to merge into one](adam)
[and then what happens?](adam)

## Metaphor #4 - chest - elicitation - Ditto

[My chest feels like it's going to explode. But it's gone very hot](other)

Since she mentions a feeling again, I'm eliciting the next metaphor ...

[and chest feels like it's going to explode](adam)
[and gone very hot](adam)
[and when chest feels like going to explode](adam)
[and going to explode like what?](adam)
[Like john hurt giving birth to an alien <img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png" />](other)
[and when it's like john hurt giving birth to an alien](adam)
[does it have a shapre or a size](adam)
[when chest going to explode](adam)
[and it's gone very hot](adam)
[?](adam)
[Not really but it feels like it's trying to push its way out. So like a sort of wobbly shape](other)
[Like a ditto](other)

## Metaphor #4 - chest - empowering & maturation - Ditto -> ping pong
[and a wobbly shape](adam)
[like a ditto](adam)
[and is there anything else](adam)
[I don't think so](other)
[when it's trying to push it's way out](adam)
[and wobbly shape](adam)
[and like a ditto](adam)
[I don't think so](other)
[and can it push it's way out?](adam)
[when it's wobbly shape](adam)
[and like a ditto](adam)
[No it just feels like it's stretching my chest up and bouncing up the wall](other)
[and strecthing chest up](adam)
[and bouncing up the wall like what?](adam)
[Sorry bouncing off the wall. So it's like... A ping pong ball made of jelly. I know that sounds weird](other)
[and a ping pong ball made of jelly](adam)
[and is there anything special](adam)
[about a ping pong made of jelly](adam)
[and what would](adam)
[a ping pong ball made of jelly](adam)
[like to do next?](adam)

# Metaphor #4 - chest - integration - ping pong

[<img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"> I think a ping pong ball made of jelly would be a pretty special thing in itself. But it just merges in with the rest of the jelly once it's bounced off the wall ](other)
[But at least it's more fluid than a rugby ball. I can breathe a bit better](other)
[and merges with the rest of the jelly](adam)
[and ping pong is merged](adam)
[and slug is merged](adam)
[and rugby ball is merged](adam)
[and toxic dirty water is merged](adam)
[and what](adam)
[happens](adam)
[next?](adam)
[Nothing that's pretty much all of it I think x](other)
[and that's pretty much all](adam)

# Testing Integration
Now that she reports everything is merged, time to test the metaphors and their respective locations.

[and is slug still in throat?](adam)
[Yes but smaller](other)
[and yes](adam)
[and smaller](adam)
[It's draining into the jelly](other)

If she didn't have any other metaphors, I'd press with the slug, like you'll see further ahead.

[and it's draining into the jelly](adam)
[and take all the time](adam)
[and draining into the jelly](adam)
[and is rugby ball still in ribcage?](adam)
[It is but it's more squishy now](other)
[and it's more squishy](adam)
[and when it's more squishy](adam)
[what does it like to do](adam)
[when it's more squishy?](adam)
[It just floats in the jelly](other)
[and just floats in the jelly](adam)
[and is toxic dirty water still in stomach?](adam)
[Yes](other)
[and yes](adam)

Here we have partial integration of the entire experience, but somehting isn't done yet. I give a clean overview first ...

[and slug is draining into the jelly](adam)
[and rugby ball more squishy, floats in the jelly](adam)
[and ping ball maade of jelly merges with all the rest of jelly](adam)
[and then what happens?](adam)
[I don't know <img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png" />](other)
[and you don't know ...](adam)

Nothing "comes" from her at this point, and we have 4 metaphors:

- Ping pong - chest - merged into Jelly
- Rugby ball - ribcage - Squishy, floats in jelly
- Slug - throat - draining into jelly slowly
- Toxic water - top of stomach - stagnat

Scroll up and notice her response to my questions about each metaphor:

- "and is slug still in throat?" -> 'Yes but smaller ... It's draining into the jelly'
- "and is rugby ball still in ribcage?" -> 'It is but it's more squishy now ... It just floats in the jelly'
- "and is toxic dirty water still in stomach?" -> 'Yes' (hint hint)

The toxic water is the only one that she just answered "Yes" about, without mentioning upcoming resolution.

So I focus on the water ...

[and what would toxic water like to do next](adam)
[and what would toxic water like to have happened](adam)

... While mentioning the other two AND the fact they are in the process of integration.

[and slug is draining into jelly](adam)
[and rugby ball more squishy, and floats in jelly](adam)
[and ping pong ball merges with rest of Jelly](adam)
[?](adam)

# Metaphor #3 - Toxic water - transformation to a resource

[Toxic water needs to filter](other)
[And become purer](other)
[and can toxic water filter](adam)
[and become purer?](adam)
[I think so](other)

Notice next how many times I'm repeating her own words about the water. I want to "give it a nudge" towards maturation and finally resolution.

[and toxic water can filter](adam)
[and become purer](adam)
[and filter ...](adam)
[and become purer ...](adam)
[and as](adam)
[it](adam)
[filter](adam)
[and become purer](adam)
[and take all the time it needs](adam)
[to filter](adam)
[and become purer](adam)
[and after it filter](adam)
[and become purer](adam)
[and what](adam)
[happens](adam)
[next?](adam)

[I feel less sick. Like my stomach is a bit more neutral](other)

This is great! Great indictaion that the water is now a resource, and the "problem" is resolved.

[and stomach more netural](adam)
[and more neutral like what?](adam)
[and when tomach is more neutral](adam)
[Water](other)
[and like water](adam)
[and what kind of water](adam)
[that water might be?](adam)
[Still](other)
[when it's more neutral](adam)
[and still water](adam)
[and is there anything else](adam)
[about still water](adam)
[that's in stomach](adam)
[and more neutral?](adam)
[It's rippling gently](other)

Now there's no question about the water being a resource, as it's behaving "gently"

[and it's rippling Gently](adam)

## Inviting integration - slug and water

Now that water is a resource, I'm inviting it to integrate / collaborate with the other yet-to-be-resolved metaphors.

I start by just mentioning the water after the slug ...

[and is slug still in throat?](adam)
[Yes](other)
[and yes](adam)
[and slug in throat](adam)
[and can slug drain into jelly?](adam)
[and what would slug like to do](adam)
[when water is still, and rippling gently](adam)
[and ping pong ball merges in jelly](adam)
[It is slowly draining but it feels a bit wedged](other)

... then directly asking if water wants to go to slug ...

[and rugby ball merge in jelly](adam)
[and would clean water](adam)
[ripling gently](adam)
[like to go to slug that is slowly draining](adam)
[and feels a bit wedged?](adam)
[The water won't go up](other)
[and water won't go up](adam)

At this point I decide to explore "wedged", since she mentioned it twice, for the rugby ball in ribcage and for the slug.

[and when slug slowly draining and feels a bit wedged](adam)
[and wedged like what?](adam)
[I don't know how to describe it](other)
[and when you don't know how to describe it](adam)
[does it have a shape or a size](adam)
[when it feels a bid wedged](adam)
[and is there anything special about feels a bit wedged](adam)
[It just feels like a huge slimy lump. It's sliding down in bulk but soo slowly](other)

Here I change my mind.

I COULD go after evolving the slug by focusing on "huge" and "slimy" and "lump", i.e. "and what kind of slug, would that slug might be, when it's huge, and slimy, and lump".

But she mentions "sliding down in **bulk**" - meaning there's a lot going on all at once, so I ride that wave ...

[and a huge slimy lump](adam)
[and sliding down in bulk](adam)
[and sliding down ...](adam)
[and slowly](adam)
[and take alllll the time in the world](adam)
[and all the time it needs](adam)
[when it's huge slimy lump](adam)
[and sliding down in bulk](adam)
[and after it slides down in bulk](adam)
[and clean water is still](adam)
[and rippling gently](adam)
[and what](adam)
[happens](adam)
[next](adam)

Seems like it's working ... ;)

[The water begins to rise and the jelly begins to dissolve into the water](other)
[and water begins to rise](adam)
[and jelly begins to dissolve into the water](adam)
[and water rise](adam)
[and jelly dissolves into water](adam)
[and then what happens?](adam)
[I'm just left with rippling water](other)

# Testing Integration - Second time

[and rippling water ...](adam)
[and is there still rugby ball in ribcage?](adam)
[Not so much now](other)
[and not](adam)
[and is slug still in throat?](adam)
[Not so much](other)
[and not](adam)
[and is toxic dirty water still in stomach?](adam)
[Not toxic water. Water yes. Toxic no.](other)

^^^ This is beautiful. It's not enough for her to "resolve the pain", she EXPLICITLY keeps the resource as well.

[and no toxic water](adam)
[and is ping pong still in chest?](adam)
[No](other)
[and no](adam)
[and is wobbly shape, like ditto, still in cheest?](adam)
[Np](other)
[No](other)
[and no](adam)
[and is large thick short courgette still in throat?](adam)
[No](other)
[and no ...](adam)
[and it is much better like this ...](adam)
[and water is still](adam)

Yup that last line was a mistake :O  
The water already went from still to gently rippling, long time ago. Sorry Tamar! Could you ever forgive this humble servant who means nothing but ecstatic futures for us all?

(Okay okay, let's get back to business ... Forgive my mind as it sometimes forgets it's place as well ...)

[Rippling](other)
[and rippling gently](adam)
[and slug no more in throat](adam)
[and toxic and dirty no longer in stomach](adam)
[and wobbly and ditto and ping pong no longer in chest](adam)
[and rugby ball no longer in ribcage](adam)
[and courgette no longer in throat](adam)
[and it is much](adam)
[better](adam)
[like this](adam)
[and](adam)
[is there anything else?](adam)

# Integration complete, and the people rejoice!

This part is CRUCIAL for a thorough integration and long lasting pervasive change. We want to explicitly check each metaphor and body area that was involved. No one gets left behind!

[Nope! Just rippling water! <img alt="🙂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z4c/1/16/1f642.png" />](other)

^^^ Ok no one "hurt" gets left behind. Resources can stay ;)

[and nope](adam)
[I think we are done here <img alt="🙂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z4c/1/16/1f642.png" />](adam)
[and how do you feel now?](adam)
[Much better!](other)
[and much better!](adam)
[Thank you! <img alt="😍" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/z2/1/16/1f60d.png" />](other)
[thank me indeed <img alt="😮" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zc1/1/16/1f62e.png" />](adam)
[and how throat feels?](adam)
[and how stomach feels?](adam)
[and stomach?](adam)
[and ribcage?](adam)
[Much better. I have a bit of stomach ache but I don't think that's related. <img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png" />](other)

Since her time was limited, I didn't go "all in" directly with the stomach ache, as you will see I bring it up a bit further ahead.

[isn't it wild?](adam)
[did you have any idea you were carrying all that inside?](adam)

Wild is a semantically packed word. I use it to induce curiousity, mystery and a sense of wonder in the client, to invite further explorations in the future. The more I can get her excited and curious about the depth of her psyche, the faster and further her future will brighten.

[No it makes u very aware of how your body feels](other)
[it does, doesn't t](adam)
[and one can only imagine the depth of the change the was done today](adam) - Inducing more curiousity and generalization of the learning/change

[and the impact will ripple gently throughout many experiences yet to come](adam) - Using her own resource words ("ripple gently") to further generalize

[as it cleans all that was toxic and dirty](adam) - Ambigous language (ALL that was toxic, instead of just the water) + past predicate ("WAS toxic")

[and slides everything to it's place](adam) - Like the bulk slide of the slug

[dissolving what's not needed anymore](adam) - Dissolving like the jelly + "not needed anymore" implies all these parts of her were always good and served a purpose.

[as new learnings take form in many unexpected ways](adam) - More curiousity and generalization

[now](adam)
[how do you feel about going to sleep tonight](adam)
[dreaming](adam)
[and waking up tomorrow?](adam)

Her dreams were a recurring issue for her, and today she woke up with intense feelings from a very vivid dream, which led to this session, so I'm checking her response to the original "problem" context.

[I hope it's better! It couldn't be much worse <img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"> but I feel much better about it! This morning I was walking around all distracted and quiet but I feel like myself again no](other)
[and feel much better](adam)
[Great](adam)
[now](adam)

[do you want to do something about the stomach?](adam)
[You can get rid of stomach ache?! <img alt="😂" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zd0/1/16/1f602.png"> ive only got 15 mins now cos I am taking my little one to baby group ](other)

[I can't but HE can](adam)

(Picture of Ally the gator here ...)

["look into my reptalian eye child ..."](adam)
[so let's see](adam)
[and when u need to go we continue later k?](adam)
[oh and if you want, to make me happy too, can leave a review and like <img alt="😮" class="_1ift _2560 img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/zc1/1/16/1f62e.png" />](adam)
[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/adamgoldman.me/reviews/">https://www.facebook.com/pg/adamgoldman.me/reviews/</a>](adam)
(^^^ Shameless self promotion, I plea guilty your honor!)

[OK!!!](other)
[tell me when you ready to start](adam)
[Got to dash. I'll let u know when I'm home!!!](other)
[lataz!](adam)
