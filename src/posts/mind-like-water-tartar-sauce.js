**U know how** sometimes you walk somewhere and **your mind yacks on and on** *"I gotta tell my boss about the missing deadline and Nicholas about the party and **don't forget the tarter sauce** and ..."*?

**Well I don't**.

Not for the past year or so, and I'm not any more [enlightened-total-zen-one-with-the-universe](I wouldn't even know what any of those mean, nor do I care ...) then your.

**I am** just [smarter](STRIKE) **luckier than you**.

I've came across David, a really interesting guy with a surprisingly fucked up history, that simplified my life in a tremendous way, [implementing a simple step by step process](http://amzn.to/2tOCqN7).

Since then, **I literally got NOTHING on my mind**.

I've delegated my life to a bunch of virtual slaves, so **I can focus on** what's really important, ***making* shit happen**, instead of constantly (re)thinking *about* the shit that *needs* to happen.

Before you**tag along as David walks you through a simple process**, do me a favor and just **have something in hands reach to jot down** some mind nibbling thoughts.

I might be like you and prefer to get the bullet points BEFORE I submerge in the details, so here it is:

# Steps
1. Try to **clear your mind** and notice the intensity of some of the thoughts that come up
2. What's **the most thought/emotion provoking thing** that pops it's head? An event, a meeting you need to attend, an intense conversation?
3. Jot that down
4. **What's the main reason** this thing exists? what's the primary purpose for this 
 event?
5. Jot that down
6. What would success mean to you for this event or thing? **How does the IDEAL scenario looks, sounds, and feels like**?
7. Jot that down
8. As you hold that success in your mind, **u might feel some tension**. This is GOOD. There's a discrepancy between now and the future success reality.
9. Your brain will want to **relieve that tension by *storming*you with ideas**.
10. Take as long as it needs to **dump ALL of that** into the screen or paper.  
(Resist the urge to organize or 'check' these ideas. This is what the NEXT step is for. Can I trust you with this?)
11. NOW begin to **organize these ideas**. What's more important? What is relevant?
What should happen first?
12. **What's the #1 most important idea** about this project
13. **What's the** very **next** **ACTIONABLE thing** that needs to happen to move this forward?  
(Bad example: set meeting; Better example: Call Sarah to set meeting next week)
14. **Highlight it and write where, with whom or what**you will do this. In your office? Your laptop? Mobile? Next time you meet Sarah? In the store?
15. Pay attention to the rest of the thoughts that might have popped during this quick experience
16. Jot 'em down and apply any of the steps only as far as you continue to enjoy it

<small>The usual response Mr. David and I get when walking clients through this process</small>

Like a breeze of fresh air you get for free without getting any smarter.

As you look at your quick accomplishment, **notice how better you feel about this "thing"** or project and your life.

Not too shabby for a few moments of your time eh?
(If you don't feel it yet, I'll go out on a limb and say you did not follow the steps, did you? Bad human! BAD!)

U haven't actually "done" or "produced" anything *per se*, BUT, your mind as one less thing to take care of. 

**U will no longer worry *about* the project** or "thing".

There's just one ACTIONABLE thing to do, in a very specific context (hint: step 14).

As I was doing this with all my past [project](STRIKE) worries, a growing sense of liberation, comfort, focus and control got stronger and stronger the more I thought about each of them for the last time.

Some of my clients experience it differently.  
Clarity, peace, relief, are just some of the things often sneak in as we do this.

And the more they apply the [whole methodology](http://amzn.to/2uMAYZa), the stronger they become.

It's real thing of beauty when it works ;)

The fastest way to transition yourself to a mind like water state is with [personal guidance](/contactNEW), and you, like me, might want to [take a swing at it on your own](http://amzn.to/2tKX01m) first.

Most importantly, don't **forget the tartar sauce**!
