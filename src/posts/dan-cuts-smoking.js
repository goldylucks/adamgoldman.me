A very nice dude, 25 years old, living in Tel Aviv with 2 roommates, dedicating a lot of his time to [The Venus Project](/blog/men-cant-think-or-reason/). He had two main things he wanted fixing.

The first was VERY intriguing for me but the second one was surprisingly easy to put to rest and took, literally, on the clock, 5 minutes.
 
He was smoking about 25 of ‘em tobacco sticks a day, and wanted to control that.
 
Dan: *“There are two cigarettes a day I actually enjoy, and would like to keep enjoying. But that’s it”*
 
The morning cig with the coffee ...

A known enemy for many ;)
 
So we have here a clear case of a bad habit, which he KNOWS is bad for him, and he’d like to stop that habit.
 
I asked him to think of some previous habits of his which he KNOWS are bad for him, and today do not appeal to him whatsoever.
 
Dan: *“Oh that’s easy! I used to eat meat, and LOTS of it. I don’t do that no more my friend. It will kinda gross me out to even try.”*
 
Hard core vegan it seems …

I had him move his internal image of a cigarette in his mind to the same lcoation of the meat, and that was that.
 
Dan: *“Oh damn … now I see a disgusting burger dripping of burned black fat with a giant cigarette in the middle. Thanks but no thanks”*
 
3 month later he reported smoking 1-3 cigs a day, enjoying each and every one.
 
But [here’s where his story get’s really interesting](/blog/dan-gets-laid/) …
