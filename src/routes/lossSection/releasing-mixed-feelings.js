Some participants have lingering feelings mixed with the loss, which needs to be addressed before proceeding with healthy resourceful grieving.

## Examples
- Intense fight prior to the death
- Thinking “I might could’ve saved him if …”
- Being angry or hurt from something the person said or did

We have a protocol for each of those, which we use to resolve those feelings, before proceeding with the loss protocol.

---

If you have any of those lingering feelings, [sign up to participate](/loss/participate) in the process so we can clear those emotions, and transform your response to a more [resourceful](/loss/resourceful-response) one.
