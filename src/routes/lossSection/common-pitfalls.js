Since no one 'taught' us how to grieve in a healthy way, we are apt to get 'stuck' in unuseful patterns.

## Recalling the ending
- Last years in the hospital
- Heated argument
- The nasty ending of the relationship
- Funerals and memorials
- Dwelling in “could’ve, would’ve, should've

## Dissociation
- Watching the two of you having fun “over there”
- The empty dinner table seat, or bed
- Transparent, faded, fuzzy, or distant representation

## Resignation
- Yeah it’s okay …
- It’s in the past now …
- I guess I just don’t think about it anymore
- I’ve dealt with it in my own way

## Pretending they are away
- Child is away at summer camp
- Adult away at business trip

## Focusing on the lost future
Mainly common among grieving parents, or when the deceased has just started something new like a marriage or getting their dream job.
