Some participants have a shock response associated with the death itself, getting in the way of healthy [resourceful grieving](/loss/resourceful-response).

## Examples
- Car accident
- Witnessing the death
- Finding child dead in room
- Getting the news
- Intense funerals and memorials

In this case we use the trauma relief protocol first to soften the impact of the moment, before [proceeding](/loss/participate) with the [loss protocol](/loss/protocol).
