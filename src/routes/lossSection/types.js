Each type of loss is unique, and have it’s own manifestations and consequences in the participants’ lives.

There are however many commonalities in the structure of how participants internally represent their loss, which the protocol is designed to transform to a more resourceful response.

## Baby / child
When losing a child in early age, participants often have two kinds of grief:
- Past to Present - Loss of the presence of the child
  Participants utilize the second part of the protocol - Reunion - to gain a more resourceful response to the loss. Before going through the protocol, they will often say things like:
  - “She had such a beaming smile”
  - “It was always brighter when he was around”
- Future - Loss of the future experience they would have had
  Participants utilize the third part of the protocol - Reengaging the future - to build a more compelling response to the future, and make sure they seek out nourishing experiences in the rest of their lives. Before going through the protocol, participants will often say things like:
  - “I will never see him growing up”
  - “She will never have that ___ she dreamed of”
  - “I won’t get to see her graduate”

## Miscarriage
More common among women, some parents feel a deep loss over the anticipated child they never got to have in their lives. For some, the loss is so severe that they will not consider attempting again, until they can respond to the miscarriage in a more resourceful way.

## Breakup / Divorce

## Pet
For some participants, losing a pet hurts just as much, if not more, than losing a close human relationship. Pets often symbolize things that seem unattainable for human relationships. Before going through the protocol, participants will say things like:
- “He wasn’t like humans, he loved me unconditionally”
- “She gave me more comfort than all my friends and family combined”
- “I lost the only one that no matter what, will never judge me, and accept me as I am”

## Pregrief / Anticipated loss
- Terminal illness
- Signs of breakup
- Codependency relationship
