Whatever it is you were looking for, it's not here my friend.

I'm so sorry to have led you astray.

would you find it in your heart to forgive me?

on the bright side, this is a great opportunity for you to [talk to me](/contactNEW), try some of my [brain hacking tools](/tools), read some [quotes](/quotes/), [books](/books/), [reviews](FB_REVIEWS), and [success stories](/transcripts).
