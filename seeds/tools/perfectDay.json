We all wish for a better life but no one stops to design it, and surprisingly enough it doesn't happen.\n\nI find that when you don't plan for feeling fantastic, you don't!\n\nIt's that simple.\n\nSome people tell me it completely shattered what they thought they wanted. For some it was an inspiration to press forward with current events to achieve it (but I'm sure you never procrascinate ...)\n\nNow think about your perfect day. Not what you think is possible, or realistic, but your IDEAL routine day and ...\n\nBe specific!\n\nGut out the details, like me:\n\n\"I wake up by the sun caressing my face and make love to the person next to me. Pet the dog that came into the hut.\n\nStep outside, greet some new comers, say hello to some who live around, and run but naked to the freezing beach.\n\nAfter I dry I practice some new skills, some on my own and mostly with others.\n\nThen I teach something to a crowd of 20-50 people.\"\n\nYou get the idea yes?\n\nDon't gimmie none of that \"I'm a CEO of a big company with 2 kids in a nice house\" crap.\n\nHalf assing in this case is worse than not doing it at all.\n\nIf you gonna do something, DO IT, or don't bother.\n\nNow let's begin.",
